feliciores ; atque hinc factum est vt passim ex omni Germania ad te
tui admodum amantes confluant litterarum cultores. E quorum
numero est et Beatus meus Arnoldus, qui quo se longe beatiorem
redderet, te vnum omnium beatissimum adire constituit3 sperans
id se facile consequuturum, si tuae humanitatis aliquo modo sibi
copiam feceris.

Si quaeris quid agam, in ludo litterario atque vxoriis rebus meo

400. FROM JEROME BALDUNG.

Ensisheim.
24 April 1516.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 173.

[Evidently written to Basle 3 and therefore only 1516 is possible.

Jerome Baldung or WValdung of Gmiind in Swabia was probably educated at
Vienna, since he speaks of Celtis as ‘ communis praeceptor' to Vadianus and
himself (VE. 394); but his name does not occur in Aschbach’s Gesch. d. Wiener
Univ. On 5 Feb. 1506 he matriculated at Freiburg and on 16 June succeeded
Zasius as Lecturer in Poetry. His subject, however, was Law, in which he took
his Doctor's degree in 1506, becoming Dean of the Faculty in 15o7; but it was
not until 27 Feb. 1510 that he was allowed to teach it. His University career
was ended by his appointment on 23 J uly 1510 to be Imperial Councillor and
Agent at Ensisheim in Alsace (cf. Ep. 319. 23). 111 1517 he was summoned to
Innsbruck as Privy Councillor to Maximilian ; see Capito’s Hebraicae Institutione&
Basle‚ Froben, Jan. 1518, 1³⁰. Pv0. He is mentioned in Zasius' Lucubrationes,
1518, p. 8, as having recently discovered at Murbach a MS. of Gaius’ Inst. bk. 1 ;
which is now lost. In 1524 he was Chancellor to the Abp. of salzburg ; and in'
1532 Zasius dedicated to him his Substimtionum Tractatus (ZE. 257). His name is
sometimes confused with Balbus’ (Ep. 23. 47 n.).

The Aphorismi compunctionis theoloyz'cales Hieronymi Balduny, artium et medicinarum
doctoris, Strasburg, J. Griininger, 6 Jan. 1497, with a preface dated from Gmiind
12 Feb. 1493, were the work of his father, who was physician to Maximilian‚
and is probably the person intended in BRE. 118 and 444.

HIERONYMVS BALDVNG ERASMO S. P.

Vm doctissime, Lucas Paliurus, homo, quantum paucis horis

Bigus Pictorius (Strasburg, Schiirer,
17 Jan. 1509). Subsequently like his

(43ffay 61⁶485——4 Oct. 1532), son of a

Arnoldus] Batt Arnolt

Schletsttadt artisan. He was B.A. at
Paris in 1504, with Beatus Rhenanus,
who was a kinsman (BRE. 5); but he
does not seem to have proceeded
MA. From 1507 to 1511 he worked
for the printers at Strasburg, and
verses by him appear in many of their
books. Also Beatus Rhenanus dedi-
cated to him the opuscula Christiana of

fellow-townsman Spiegel (Ep. 323. 12
11.) he became Secretary to Maximilian ·
and afterwards to Charles v; and in
that capacity he was able to be of use
to his literary friends in matters of
copyright. He died at Vienna. See
