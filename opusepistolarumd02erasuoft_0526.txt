547. FROM RICHARD BARTHomNUS.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 116. Antwerp.
E. p. 197: LB. App. 392. <March 1517).

[These verses are included here as they serve to confirm the dates of
Epp. 548,9. They were omitted in all the authorized editions after E but are
printed in LB from the manuscript. The sequence may be taken as follows:
that Bartholinus being at Antwerp wrote these lines to ask for an interview;
but that aster this was arranged, he was prevented from coming and wrote
Ep. 548 to apologize‚ sending with it Ursinus’ Genethliacon (Ep. 548. 3 n.). The
answer to such a complimentary effusion would hardly be long delayed.

Richard Bartholinus of Perugia held a canonry in his native town3 and
besides teaching there, had sel-ved on embassies to Florence and Rome. By
1515 he had become secretary to Matthew Lang (Ep. 549. 48 n.) 3 and his first
published work is an ocleporicon‚ Vienna, H. vietor, 13 Sept. 1515, describing
their journey from Augsburg (11 Feb. 1515) to Vienna for the meet-,ing of
sovereigns which culminated in the treaty of 22 July. He remained with
Lang, and sought preferment by composing court poeti-y (see NBG.) ; the most
notable of these productions being Austrum, an epic in twelve books on the war
between Bavaria and the Palatinate in 1504—5, in the diplomacy of which his
patron Lang had had a part ; first published by Schiirer at Strasburg, Feb. 1516,
for the Alantsees of Vienna (cf. VE. 58, 62, 75-7, 79). But his only reward
was the promise of a pension from Maximilian (VE. 108); and about Oct. 1519
he returned disappointed to Perugia to reopen his school (VE. 173). Hutten
speaks of him with contempt (HE. 164). In the Index to H he is described as
canon of Spolet0; but Mazzuchelli states that this is an error. From the
oaeporicon‘ (ἕο. B) it appears that he was a nephew of Marianus Bartholinus
(1465-1509); for whom also see Mazzuchelli‚ and notes by Spiegel (p. 48) to
the Austrias, bk. ii fin„ in an edition by Schott, Strasburg, 26 Aug. 1531.]

HERASMO MVSARVM PARENTI RICCHARDVS BARTHOLINVS.

Herasme, nobis, si quid oci iam potes,
Imparties: nam principem ad te Hellanidos
Graece peritum et nobilem et probum afferam.
Depone frontis tetricae rugas tuae et
Remitte studii paululum grauis genus.
Non integrum deposcit ipse abs te diem,
Verum trientem, si minus, quincuncem. Age
Largire; si non sic lubet, sic vt lubet

- Agatur. Is te videat ac noscat modo.
Namque arbitratur—sic tuum ingenium colit—
Se vel Platonem vel beatum Socratem
