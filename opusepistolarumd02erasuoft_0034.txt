10 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1514

5 sacratiora tua adyta temeritate aliqua impiarem‘? Sed Bonifacii
adulescentis optimi suasu fidentior factus, qui tuam singularem
humanitatem praedicare non cessat, haec rurestria ad te dedi; tantum
precatus me non quidem clientibus tuis (nec enim me tali dignor
honore), sed mediastinis certe seruitiis adscribas. Ero enim ita tibi

10 a pedibus, ab atriis, a pauimento, a verriculis, a scopis seruus, vt
reiectaneorum nihil sim abominaturUS, dum vel vestibula tua mihi
verrere concedatur.

Vale, decus orbis, non dico Germani, sed omnium viuentium
splendor. Nos in iure ciuili, quod profitemur, mendicula quaedam
15 pro veris intellectibus contra aliorum communia sensa meditamur3
in quibus mihi, vt mortalibus Deus, praedicaris. Denuo vale.
Ex Fryburgo vii idus Septemb. 1514.
Tuus Vdalricus Zasius,
Legum et doctor et ordinarius in Achademia Fryburgensi.

[This letter was not at hand (cf. Ep. 356) when Erasmus' reply was printed
by Froben in A, August 1515. The best text of it (a) is supplied by one of the
Gouda manuscripts (App. 9). It was first published in Martens' reprint of
Erasmus' Euam-atio in primum Psalmum, Oct. 1515 (β’), and afterwards by Badius,
with Ep. 337, in the Moria, 24 June 1524 (βῖ). The Bibliotheque Royale at
Brussels has a manuscript copy (γ) 111 the volume written by Martin Lypsius (cf.
Ep. 296 introd.) 3 which was probably made from the printed book like some of
Lypsius' other extr-acts in the same volume. There is also a xviic manuscript
copy in the University Library at Utrecht (No. 843, f. 83) by the hand of
Arnold Buchelius (1565—1641); but as some specimen readings, with which
Prof. van Someren has kindly furnished me, agree uniformly with βῙ, it may

be inferred that the manuscript was probably copied either directly οι· indirectly
from the printed book.

contain such headings as ‘ Intellectus solent quae vehementissimis fluctibus

reference to Erasmus in the Intellectus, words quoted in it from Erasmus.
