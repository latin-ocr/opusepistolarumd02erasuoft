144 LETTERS or ERASMUS [1515

355301 FRoM JOHN KIRHER.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 151 v0. Spires.
Ε. p. 199: F. p. 333: HN: Lond. vii. 44: LB. 184. 16 September 1515.

[The date cannot be certainly confirmed. Only 1514 and 1515 are possible,
since Erasmus’ answer is dated from Basle. “

John Kirher of Schlettstadt († July 1519) spent much of his life at Spu-es,
where for ten years he lived with Truchses (1. 49 n.). In 1508 he published
an edition (Spires‚ Conr. Hist.) of Filelfo's Conuiuia, which he had found in
Truchses’ library ; and there are verses by him in Schiirer's edition of Landinus'
Quaestiones, 1508. In May 1509 Beatus Rhenanus dedicated to him G. Trapezontii
Dialectica (BRE. 8); at which time he was teaching, perhaps in the Cathedral
school at Spires. In September he went to study in Paris and was admitted
B.A. in 1509—10 on a degree obtained elsewhere. Though MA. in 1510, he was
still in Paris in July 1512. It appears that at some time he was at Freiburg
with Boniface Amerbach, perhaps as a fellow-student under Zasius (Basle MS.
G. II. 20. 118) 2 probably early in 1515, sor by June (l. 4 11.) he had returned to
spires, where he took orders (Basle MS. vbi supra) and received a canonry in
the Cathedral. See Schmidt, BRE. and MHE.]

ΕΤΕΙ diu antea, Erasme doctissime iuxta et disertissime, tuam erga
studiosos humanitatem comitatemque exploratam habui, idque ex
variis ingenii tui clarissimis monumentis, quae has simul et alias
virtutes consequio trahere solent; tamen ab eo tempore quo Spirae
nobiseum prorsus hylare versatus es, tuam in omnes facilitatem longe
clarius perspexi. Ita enim humaniter atque amoeniter te nobis prae-
stitisti, vt ingens cunctis te amandi colendique desyderium reli-
queris3 quod inde cuiuis ad liquidum patere potest, quod omnes vno
ore Erasmum laudent, loquantur, praedicent, vnum vere doctum,
vnum modestum dulcemque conuiuam dictitantes: sibique diuinitus
contigisse autumant, quod tua non solum praesentia vti, sed (quae tua
est affabilitas) familiaritate etiam frui potuere. Quae cum ita sint,
in spem venio haud dubiam, me abs te quod pete, communis amici
causa non grauate impetraturum. Incidit nuper Maternus noster,
