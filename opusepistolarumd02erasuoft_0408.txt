DOMINO ERASMO GERARDVS NOVIOMAGVS S. D. P.

VTOPIAE imprimendae prouinciam The<o>doricus noster lubens
ac gaudens suscepit. Insulae ipsius figuram a quodam egregio
pictore effictam Paludanus noster tibi ostendet; si quid mutatum
velis, scribes aut figurae annotabis. Exemplaria Epistolarum tuarum

5 in aduentum tuum huc diligentissime custodiam ; si vero ad te mitti
velis, mittentur quamprimum. Adhibebo omnem diligentiam vt
Vtopia ornate in publicum prodeat ; vt prosit lectori, non offendat.
Dorpius desyderat aduentum tuum ad nos; quem si distuleris,
ipse constituit venire ad te. Persancte iurat se nemini mortalium
10 praeter vnum aut alterum ostendisse litteras tuas aut suaS, neque
se sparsisse aliquem rumorem apud theologos de tuis operibus, sed
culpam nescio in quos reiicit. Spero rem eo peruenturam vt Dorpius
Erasmi posthac consiliis non poenitendis acquiescat.
Gaudeo Michaelem theologum tibi placere ; forte hoc debet Nebris—
15 sensi praeceptori suo. Multum enim refert a quo prima aetas
instituatur. Sed sus Mineruam. Optime Erasme, non sit tibi
molestum quod tam impudenter tibi scribo, et apud te in optimis
studiis occupatissimum hiscere audeo. Condonabis hanc culpam
aniori erga te nieo.

14. Nebrissensi] Aelius Antonius
(1444-2 July 1522 ‘?) of Lebrixa‚ N. of
cadiz. He states in the preface to his
Spanish-Latin lexicon (1494) that he
was born in the year before the battle
of Olmedo and at the time of writing
was nearly fifty 3 that after five years at
Salamanca he went at the age of nine-
teen to Bologna to perfect himself in
Latinity3 and that after ten years he
was invited to return to Spain by
Alphonso Fonseca, Abp. of Seville
(† 1473 5³), in whose household he then
spent three years till Fonseca's death:
but his figures do not quite agree.
He further states that he then taught
for twelve years at Salamanca, where
he was professor of grammar and
rhetoric; and that he had been for
seven years in the household of John
Stunica: an ecclesiastic who in 1503
became Abp. of Seville. On Stunica’s
death (ψ 14 Oet. 1504) he returned to

Salamanea, and taught there again;
his attitude towards the interpreta-
tion of Scripture being very close to
that of Erasmus. About 1515 attacks
on his orthodoxy moved ximenes to
protect him, and to confer upon him
a chair at Alcala, which he held until
his death.

His writings include a Latin
grammar, first published at Salamanca
in 1485 ; a Latin-Spanish and Spanish-
Latin lexicon, ibid. 1492 and s. a. 3 edi-
tions of Pomponius Mela, ibid. 1498,
Persius, SevilIe, c. 1504, Sedulius, Sala-
manca, 1510, P. Martyr Anglerius, De
orbe nouo, Sevssle, 1511, Prudentius,
Logroiio, 1512; and three Quinquayenae
of critical notes on Scripture, *ἓ 1514-16.
About 1509 he was appointed historio-
grapher to Ferdinand ; but his work in
this office was not printed until 1545.
He is credited with a share in the Com-
plutensian Polyglott, 1514-17 ; but
his name does not appear in it. See

Ferdinand and Isabezla, ch. 12 and
ch. 195 a sketch by H. Suana, Madrid,
1879; and Ι. Bywater, The Erasmian
Pronunciation of Greek, Oxford, 1908.
