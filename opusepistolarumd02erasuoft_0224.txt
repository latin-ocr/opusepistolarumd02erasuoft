LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1516

Linacer, mihi crede, Erasme, de te et optime sentit et vbique loquitur 3
id quod ego nuper ab his accepi qui ei amantissime atque effusissime
apud Regem in caena de te loquenti affuere: quo in sermone Rex ea
vicissim respondit, vt hi qui mihi retulerunt, opinionem plane con*
ceperint fore vt breui aliquid egregiae in te fortunae conferatur 3 quod
ego superos precor vt ratum esse velint.

Vale, Erasme charissime, et Rhenanum ,et Lystrium meo nomine
saluta ; quos ego et tua predicatione et ipsorum scriptis et chariores
habeo et penitius etiam notos quam multos ex his quibuscum versor

cotidie.

onr mea te salutat, et item Clemens, qui literis et Latinis

et Graecis ita proficit indies vt non exiguam de eo spem concipiam,
futurum eum aliquando et patriae et literis ornamento,

Iterum vale atque his vnis literis in multos menses esto contentus:
quibus auaros sum imitatus; qui quod raro quemquam inuitant, si
quando ad caenam vocant, prolixissime conuiuium instruunt, vt vna.

coena. cotidianum sumptum inuitandi effugiant.

Iam tertio vale.

Episcopus Dunelmensis inscriptionem Senecae gratissimam habuit.
Vide quam te libenter imiter, qui tibi nunc itidem vt tu nuper mihi
aliena manu scribo, tam certus imitator, vt ne hoc quidem meapte
manu fuerim scripturus nisi vt certum tibi facerem literas has meas

164. Linacer] Erasmus had for some
years been doubtful of Linacre's feel-
ings towards him; cf. Epp. 237. 54—9,
350. 5 seq.‚ 502. 18‚9‚ and 513. 8,9.

173. Clemens] John Clement (Ἰ- 1 July
1572) was a pupil of Lily at St. Paul's
school. He became servant-pupil to
More, whom in 1515 he accompanied
on his embassy to Bruges <Pi-ef. to
Utopz'a). He made rapid progress with
classical learning, and in Sept. 1516
was able to help Colet with Greek
(Ep. 468. 12). In (Dec. 1517) he was
still in More's household (Brewer ii.
App. 17), where he acted as tutor to
the children3 but in April 1518 had
entered the service of Wolsey (Lond.
iii. 13; LB. 242). In the autumn of
1518 Wolsey sent him to Oxford as the
first of his newly-founded Readers in
Humanity (Brewer ii. App. 56), and
he was lodged in Foxe’s college of
Corpus Christi. By the spring of
1520 he had left Oxford for Louvain
(Lond. Mor. 1 ; Jortin ii. 396) to study
medicine; to which he now devoted
himself. Two years later (Lond. Viv.
6²², 7; LB. 615, 619> he went on to
Italy3 where, together with his suc-
cessor in the Oxford Readershsp, Lu pset
(Ep. 270. 60 n.), and two other English-

183. asscripturus (J.

men, Odoardus and Roseus, he helped
to edit the Aldine Galen, Apin-Aug.
1525, 5 vols. folio (the first edition in
Greek) : see pref. to vol. v. f0. ff. On
returning from Italywith the degree of
M.D. (probably from Padua) he ob-
tained employment about the court,
and on 1 Feb. 152} was admitted a
member of the College of Physicians
in London ; becoming President in
1544. About 1530 he married Margaret
Giggs, More’s kinswoman and inmate
of his house 3 for whom see DN B.

He adhered to the Roman supremacy,
and wit-hdrew under Edward Vt to
Louvain ; returning to England under
Mary. But on the accession of Elizabeth
he again retired to rthe Netherlands
and settled at Mechlin‚ where he died.

Simon Grynaeus’ edition of Proclus'
De motu, Basle, Bebel, Aug. 1531, is
dedicated to Clement, with a preface
which refers to his work on Galen
when in Italy; and also suggests that it
was from him that Grynaeus received
the MS. of Proclus when visiting Eng-
land in the spring of 1531. See DNB. ;
Rendel Harris, Leicester Codex, pp. 46, 7,
and 53-6, for MSS. belonging to him;
and Bridgett, Lzse ofMore, p. 12611·
