586] TO THE DUKES OF SAXONY 579

and revised by Erasmus (11²), who besides correcting the obvious blunders of
the secretary also rewrites and amplifies the text in places. τι.1 necessarily takes
precedence of ‹2¹; but it is not always easy to distinguish between them,
especially when the correction is in the form of a letter, such as the addition
of the cedilla by which e is made into ae. Erasmus often 30 transforms
Hand D's e3 but these corrections and such as seem made by the secretary
himself are not worth reproducing.

The Hist. Auq. Scriptores were printed by Froben in June 1518 (6¹), Duke
Frederick being included in the dedication3 and again by Froben’s successore
in July 1533 (γ). It is noticeable that from 1. 62 onwards Erasmus makes the
dedication to both Dukes even in the manuscript (11²), although the heading
and opening sentences are left unchanged. In printing he seems to have
dcsigned to amplify his preface for 5¹, but after a few lines he abandoned the
undertaking, and the substantial revision is not made until γ. The Gouda MS.
(82) is evidently copied from 8¹.

In a preface to the reader (ΐο. βε, 1518) dated 23 June 1518 and perhaps written
by Erasmus, Froben states that for Spartianus and the following authors he was
able to use a MS. of Spartianus borrowed from Murbach, and Egnatius' Caesares
(Ep. 588. 55 n.), which he received through Franksort, probably the autumn
fair of 1517 ; but that the volume was far advanced before these reached him.

of Luther and the Reformation, see ADB; and, for his relations to Erasmus,

The date is confirmed by the fact that in no other year was Erasmus at

Antwerp at this time]
