qui per obliuionem aliud scribit et asseuerat quam res habet, is
demum labitur memoria.
Haec paucis attigi, iam ad iter accinctus et ab aula fessus, Nihil
25 mihi potes facere gratius quam si ad hunc modum de caeteris item
admoneas ita, vt facis, amice. Bene vale, decus Galliarum ac
literarum antistes. Antuerpiae pridie idus Iulias.

NVENAR COMES S. D. P.

erERAE tuae ex Antwerpia redditae mihi fuerunt Gal. Iuliis 3 ex
quibus intellexi facile et quanto me studio prosequaris, hominem
immeritum scilicet qui a tali viro laudetur, et quanto me officio tibi
deuinxeris‚ adeo vt in vtroque succumbere habeam necesse. Sed

tum quod me tacente et Democriti more perpetuas latebras quaeri-
tante tu prior et a me nullis scriptis stimulatus ignorantiae pro-
10 sessorem prouocandum duxisti3 res tuo splendore digna, sed quae
me adeo obtuderit vt in quam partem mihi declinandum fuerit,
haud liquide perspicere potuerim. Noui candorem diuini ingenii
