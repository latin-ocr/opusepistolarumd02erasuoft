also to an expected visit of Beatus Rhenanus to Strasburg (cf. Ep. 338 introd.).
Also‚ this letter has the tone of being written to Basle rather than to Brabant.

Wolfgang Angst of Kaysersberg (cf. Ep. 412. 3 n.) is known only as a corrector
for the presa. His name has not been traced in the records of any university 3
but Schmidt conjectures (ii. 155) that he may have been with Hutten at Cologne,
for in a poem written in 1510 (Opp. iii, p. 78) Hutten speaks of him as ‘quondam
meus’, and praises his knowledge of Plautus. In Feb. 1510 he corrected an
edition of the Tusculanae Qua-estimes for Schiirer at Strasburg, and in N ov. 1514—
March 1515 the opus concionawmwn of Sancius de Porta for Gran at Hagenau.
In Sept. 1516 he may be found at Strasburg (v. supra) ; but by the next summer
he had moved to Basle and was correcting the Aclayia for Froben's edition
of Nov. 1517 (Ep. 575, and LB. App. 146, 166). In Sept. 1518 he had left
Basle (Basle MS. G. ΙΙ. 3ο ad sim), evidently for Mainz‚ where in 1518-19 he
corrected for Schoffer (HE. 110 and 96) the Livy to which Hutten contributed
a preface and also Hutten’s De Gzcaz'acimedicina‚Ap1·. 1519; but after that time
nothing is known of him. Erasmus' preface to him, mentioned in Lond. vi. 14,
LB. 413, is not known to exist.

See an article by Mohnicke in Ersch and Gruber’s Encyczopciczie‚ corrected in
several points by Bocking; and Schmidt, ii. pp. 154-8.]

[This letter responds to a poem from Sapidus which precedes it in the various
editions of the Epis-tolete. The poem enumerates Erasmus' friends in Basle‚
Gerard Lister, Bruno and Basil Amorbach, Beatus Rhenanus, Froben, Nesen,
Glareanus, Oecolampadius‚ Gerbell, Artolphus, and Fonteius ; and congratulates
them on enjoying his society. The presence of Gerbell and Oecolampadius
enables the letter to be dated approximately3 cf. Ep. 358. 5 n. Gerbell had returned
to Strasburg by Dec. 1515 (MHE. ii. 36). See also l. 30 n. Sapidus' poem was
perhaps intended as a reply to the Encomium Slestadii ; cf. Ep. 353. 9 n. He replied
to thEe quasi-invitation conveyed in this letter by visiting Basle in November ;
see p. 372. 2.
