382 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 51 6

voluptate, ita dici non queat quam me oblectarint litterae tuae,
quibus de felici statu tuo me certiorem reddidisti. Itaque cum
5 amicorum omnia sint communia, mihi equidem gaudeo tuaeque
dignitati summae gratulor de tam honorifica et vbere a Principe
oblata prebenda canonica deque tam prospero rerum tuarum
successu, vt fortuna literarum et virtutis studiosis semper nouercari
solita, abs te quemadmodum contempta, ita et victa et prorsus tibi
10 dedita videatur. Nec obtrectatorum quorundam insania, magis
quidem elaborantium vt accuratissima tua scripta et exquisitiorem
doctrinam aliqua ex parte falso calumnientur quam vt sane et
cum fructu intelligant, felicitatem tuam imminuere poterit, sed
augebit potius. Quae enim spes gloriae, si nulla victoria *ἓ victoriae
15 autem quis loeus esse potest vbi pugna non est ‘? Sed neque desunt
nec vnquam deerunt Erasmo doctissimi et optimi patroni, quan-
quam ipse sibi abunde et patronus et semper Deo duce futurus est
victor gloriosus.
Literas tuas ac item Archiepiscopi Cantuariensis ad reuerendum
20 dominum Basiliensem eius reuerendae paternitati diligenter redden-
das curaui. Aliarum etiam literarum exempla ad me transmissa,
mihi quidem abs te munus gratissimum, communibus amicis nostris,
vt decebat, communicaui. Vale semper felix in Christo.

4895ae FROM Loms CANOSSA.

Epistole elegantes s0. l. Amboise.
(3². p. 125: F. p. 43: HN: Lond. i. 20: LB. 224. 13 November 1516.

[The date is unquestionable.

Leuis Count of Canossa (1476—30 Jan. 1532) was born at Verona of a good
family, and was trained in the court of Urbino‚ where he made the acquaintance
of Baldassare Castiglione. Being employed on an embassy to Rome, he won the
favour of Julius 11, who sent him in 1512 as Papal ambassador to Franco. He
showed himself a capable diplomatist, especially in negotiating the under-
standing between England and France in 1514, and as a reward he was made
Bishop of Tricarico 1 Jan. 1515. Theneeforward he was employed in the
interests of France, and received the see of Bayeux Aug. 1516 and later an
annual pension of 40001ivres. He was sent on an embassy to Italy 1519-20‚
and from 1523-8 was French ambassador to Venice. Ill health eompelled him
to resign his various offices ; and he died in his native land.

About 60 letters by him are printed in Ziletti's Lettere di Principi, 1581,
i and ii ; and there is a sketch by Manem, Verona, (1845), with ten more
letter-53 see also Brewer and GC. xi. 385‚6.

Two of the letters in Ziletti are to Ammonius (i. ff. 17 νο and 18 νος Brewer
ii. 2619 and 2621), dated Nov. and 1 Dec. 1516, and deal with this proposal
made to Erasmus. The second alludes jestingly to his meeting with Erasmus
