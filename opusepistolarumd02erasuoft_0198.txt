172 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 5 1 5

2²5 Hoc igitur animo cum ego dederim haec, optime lector, fac vt tu
quoque simili accipias. Ea res vtrique nostrum commodo futura est.
Nam et tu plus capies vtilitatis, si libenter et candide quod donatur
acceperis, et me mearum vigiliarum minus poenitebit, si cognouero
bonis vsui fuisse. Quod si quis existet vel adeo praefractus ac moro·
230 sus, vel adeo durus et iniquus, vt nullis incantamentis deliniri queat,
ab hoc certe vel precibus illud impetrare nitar, vt hoc saltem aequitatis
tribuat piis studiis quod tribunalia tribuunt parricidiis et sacrilegiis.
Illic turpe iudicatur si cognitionem anteuertant calculi, nec pronun-
ciatur nisi causa diligenter excussa. Legat prius ac inspiciat, deinde, si
2 35 videatur, damnet ac reiiciat. Superbum est de libro ferre sententiam
quem non intelligas, superbius et de eo quem ne legeris quidem.
Vale lector, quisquis es ; quem etiam atque etiam rogo vt si quid
fructus e nostris excerpseris lucubrationibus, officii memor, vt Chri·
stiano dignum est, me vicissim piis votis Christo commendes: a quo vno
240 solidum laboris huius praemium expectamus. Basilaeae. An. M.D.xv.

374. FROM JOHN CAESARIUS.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 197 νο. Cologne.
LB. App. 93. 3 December (1515).

[1515, because of Glareanus⁷ return from Italy 3 cf. Ep. 328. 57 and Schreiber's
Glareanus, p. 25.

John Caesarius of Jiilich (1468 ?—15 Dec. 1550) matriculated at Cologne
9 Nov. 1491, but subsequently went to Paris, where he was a pupil of Faber
StapulensiS, and learnt from him to dislike the scholastic philosophy. He was
RA. there in 1496-7, M.A. 1498 ; but did not make the acquaintance of Erasmus
at this period. For a time he taught in St. Lebuin’s school at Deventer, and
also corrected for R. Paffroet- ; see his preface to Paffroet's edition, 26 Nov. 1504,
of Clicthove⁷s Fundamentum Loyice. He also contributed a preface dated 30 May
1507, to an edit10n S. l. eta. of Faber Stapulensis’ introduction to the Arithmetic
of Boethius. In Dec. 1508 he accompanied Hermann Count of Neuenahr to
Italy, and worked at Greek in Bologna. On his return c. 1510 he established
himself as a private teacher at Cologne, and was so successful as to draw many
pupils from the regular professore. Amongst his pupils were Glareanus, Listrius,
Corn. Agrippa, Mosellanus, Bullinger, and many young noblemen. His life
from this time forward was principally spent at Cologne, but he paid frequent
visits elsewhere. He went to Miinster in the autumn of 1512 to deliver a course
of lectures on Greek (Reichling,10h. Murmellms, p. 80); and again in 1518—19
(EE2. 1) to avoid the plague. In 1527 he was at Leipzig and in 1529 at Mainz ;
and in his later years he frequently enjoyed the hospitality of the Counts of
Stolberg in the Harz and VVm. Count of Neuenahr at Mors. He was a friend of
some of the Reformers 3 but like Erasmus remained within the Church.
Erasmus dedicated to him his translations of Gaza's Grammar (Ep. 428).
Amongst Caesarius-⁸ works are editions of Boethius, Horace, and Pliny’s Natural
History.

Some of his letters are printed by C. Krafft in Zs. d. bery. Geschz'chtvereins, vi.
(1869), pp. 315-24 ; and others by C. and W. Krafft in Briejfe u. Documente aus d.
Zez‘t sl. Rfformation, 1875. See also Bocking corrected by Krafft in Butzbach.]
