85 loqueretur. Mitto tuae humanitati Eckii nostri theologi honorifi-
centissime de te sentientis aliquot Orationes.

387. FRoM THOMAS BEDILL.

London.
10 February (1516).

Deventer MS. 91, f. 135.
LB. App. 49.

[For the date only 1516 is possible3 for Erasmus' first proposal was to dedicate
Jerome, and not the New Testament, to the Pope, and for that he was still'
negotiating in May 1515 (Epp. 333-5): and by Feb. 1517 the New Testament
was in circulation. Cf. also Ep. 389. 48 seq.

Thos. Bedill († Sept. 1537) was B.O.L. from New Collega, Oxford‚ on 5 Nov.
1508. By 1516 he had become Secretary to Warham= in which capacity he
rendered frequent service to Erasmus. On Warham’s death Henry vnr
appointed him clerk to the Privy Council 3 and he was employed in the business
of the divorce, the examination of Fisher and More, and the suppression of the
monasteries. See DNB. (Bedyll), which gives a long list of his preferment,
beginning in 1512.]

THOMAS BEDILLVS DOMINO ERASMO S.

ERAsME doctissime, salutem. Egi negocium tuum de pensione
diligenter apud dominum, qui scripsit ad Maruffum vti integrum
transmittat: quod sese curriculo praestiturum promisit et Moro et
mihi praesenti. Approbat dominus vehementer consilium tuum,

5 quod destinaueris consecrare Nouum Testamentum tua opera ver·
sum summo Pontifici, et per omnes numeros te summis laudibus ’
extollit, Vbicunque incidit tui memoria (quod sepe me auctore con·
tingit), quod tot labores et vigilias exhauris in optimis litteris, et di-
uinis Scripturis3 quae nominis immortalitatem tibi non modo pro-

10 mittunt, sed persoluerunt. Pro quibus dominus meus persancte
spopondit, se nunquam defuturum quo minus te pro meritis abunde·
iuuet: quod vberius quotidie tua Do. perspiciet et, quicquid Bedillus

potest, nomen (non) desyderabit quod diu viuat, et optime valeat.

Ex Londino x Februarii.

386. 85. Eckii] John Eck, who is here
intended, had published two collec-
tions of Orationes at this time; Augs-
burg, J. Otmar, 24 Dec. 1513, and
Augsburg, Miller, 5 Dec. 1515. He
had been Professor of Theology at
Ingolstadt since 1510.

387. 2. Maruffum] Raphael Maruffo‚
a merchant of Genoa, who was already
in England in 1509. Erasmus' Alding-
ton pension (Ep. 255 introd.) was

usually paid through him; and com<
plaints of his action in the matter are
not infrequent. On this occasion he
seems to have made some deductions

for transmission. In 1522 he appears .

as a Papal agent in England for the
sale of dispensations (Brewer iii. 2163
and v. 703). In the spring of 1535 he
visited Erasmus at Freiburg, when on
his way to Genoa.
