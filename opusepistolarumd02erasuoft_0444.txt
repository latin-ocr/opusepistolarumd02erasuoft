416 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1516

whose support he won for Luther. After Frederick’s death ( 1525) he retired to
Altenburg, where he had held a canonry since 1511, and married. He enjoyed
the confidence of Duke John († 1532); and on the succession of his pupil
John Frederick his influence at the Gourt of Saxony increased even more ; and
he used it to promote the interests of the University of Wittenberg.

His literary work began with a small glossar-y contributed to a Laus Musarum
ex Hesiodi Theoyonia, Erfurt, H. Sertorius, 1 Oct. 15013 compiled by Nich.
Mai-scham, to whom he was then seeretary. But his principa] achievements
were in translation into German3 from Plutarch and Justinian, Luther and
Melanchthon. Of Erasmus 116 translated Ep. 2883 the Adages, Sileni Alcibiadis,
1520 (ΒΕΓ.2 Adayia, p. 551, where Prof. Ehwald kindly informs me that the
autograph dedication is by Spalatfflus, not by Erasmus), and Aut regem aatsatuum
nasci oportere, with preface dated 7 March 1520; the Querela Pacis, 1521 (preface
19 Apr. 1520); and the Institutio Principis Christiani, 1521 (preface 5 May 1520).
He also wrote a life of Duke Frederick ; and annals for 1513-26.

See ADB, with an excellent bibliography, especially of his letters, of which
great numbers survive in MS.; and EE. For a description of his personal
appearance see SE. 58.]
