xx ADDEN DA AND CORRIGENDA

that the battle of Marignano (13, 4 Sept. 1515) is mentioned in Eov. i. 35. But
the news of the battle had certainly reached Basle by 2 Oct. (Ep. 360), and
perhaps earlier; and it is therefore by no means impossible that it should have
been known to the authors of Eov. in time for the insertion of it in one of the
later letters (Eov. i contains only 41 in all) and the publication of the book by
19 Oct. Bauch' s typographical arguments are discussed in the Centralblatt, xv,

pp. 490 seq. by Steiff3 who enforces his former and seemingly unanswerable
demonstration (Buchdruck in Τᾱόίηρεη, pp. 217, 8 n.‚) that the first edition of
Eov. was printed by Gran at Hagenau.

P. 164, Ep. 373 introd. Dr. M. R. James has shown that the scribe of the
Leicester Codex was a Greek, Emmanuel of Constantinople (xv0. med.) ;
and that the MS. was perhaps written by him in Cambridge after 1472 τ
see Journal os TIzeolofsical Studies‚ v (1904), pp. 445-7‚ and xi (Jan. 1910).

Ρ. 182‚11.1,2o. 1. p. 14. 5 seq. should have been cited in addition to the
references to 1v.

P.202.Ni0.13as011 was a friend of Mutianus in 1503 and probably earlier; see
RE. 87 and MRE1. 293 = MRE2. 2 and 302.

P. 209, Ep. 395 introd. Ellenbog's correspondence with Gallus Knoringer‚
Prior of the Benedictine monastery of St. Magnus at Fiissen in Bavaria,
is copied in a manuscript volume belonging to Knoringer 3 which is now
the property of the Ponickau estate at Fiissen.

P. 295, 1. 98 n. For xv0. read xv0.

P. 390, Ep. 493 introd. From the frequent agreement between 0¹ and β,
extending even to the reproduction of errors (cf. Ep. 522. 52), Ι incline to
think that Budaeus must have used 0¹, and not his own manuscripts,
as the basis for the text of those letters (Epp. 403, 435, 493, 522) which he

printed in BE3. Similarly for Ep. 583 he seems to have used as his basis
either D² or F3 cf. Ep. 583. 158 and 294.

LIST OF PLATES

raon
1. Deventer Letter- book, f. 121 v0, written by Hand A 111 its straight
and curved form; Ep. 370 . 160
In the manuscript the pdifference of ink makes it easy to discern
the operations of the xviiic. editor (not Leclerc: presumably De
la Faye.); e.g. in 1. 1, the enlargement of the initial o of
octobribus, in l. 4 the alteration of o to u, and the addition
of c (1. 5) to percontari. Το him are due also the heading
(copied, without scrupulous accuracy‚ from the foot of the
preceding page), the marginalia, the underlines, the accents
over a and e, and the commas of upright form (eg. after
quidem 1. 2; after perlatae l. 3).
2. Deventer Letter -book‚ f. 164, written by Hand A in its curved
form, and corrected by Erasmus; Ep y481 . 371

and the xviiiss. editor. In the margin Erasmus writes h9modi
phi, which is exp anded and altered by the xviiic. editor. In
l. 11 the last letter of siue added by Erasmus is made by the
xviiic. editor to t; but e seems clear.
