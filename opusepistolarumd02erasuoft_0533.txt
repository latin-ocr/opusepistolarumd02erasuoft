553] FROM JEROME EMSER 505

throughout Germany to win support for a crusade. In 1503—4 he left the
cardinal, and spent some months at Strasburg‚ editing for John Priis the works
of Pico della Mirandohr, 15 March 1504. At Eastor he matriculated at Erfurt;
but in the winter moved to Leipzig, where on 5 Jan. 1505 he was appointed
to lecture in Theology. Sliortly afterwards he entered the service of Duke
George of Saxony, and was employed on various commissions‚ such as the
attempt to procure the canonization of Benno, Bp. of Meissen (†1106); in
aid of which he wrote a Latin hymn on the Bp. in 1505, and, after pro-
longed researches, biographies in Latin (1512) and German (1517). About 1511
he received prebends at Dresden and Meissen, which set him free for litei-ary
work, though still iu Duke George's service. In 1519 he appeared as a champion
of orthodoxy against Luther, and was thenceforward exposed to bitter abuse
from the Lutherans, such as his by no means spotless character was unsuited
to face. He attacked Luther's translation of the New Testament and in 1527
produced a new version of his own. Amongst the humanists he had many
friends. Bebel (p. 45) dedicated to him a small treatise on Hebrew pro-
nunciation‚ in his commentaria epistolamm conficiendarum, Tiibingen, T. Anshehn,
July 1511, and Pirckheimer (p. 40) a translation of Lucian’s Rlzetor, Hagenau‚
T. AnsheIm, Jan. 1520. See biographies by P. Mosen, 1890, with a bibliography
and G. Kawerau, 1898; ΕΕ. and ADB.]

Snvn, Erasme, vas electionis et secunde post Paulum doctor
gentium. Aeditiones tuas (quas lippis tamen et inunctis lego oculis)

ctrinam, ita Christianus ille tuus Miles Christianam omnem redolet

Rite bonas artes cum relligione vetustas
Contulit, at nobis littera sola placet.
Scire volunt omnes hodie, bene viuere nemo:
’ Heu frustra- sapiunt qui sibi nil sapiunt. 10
Quam bene priscorum calles imitatus Erasmus
Psalterium cytharae commodat, ora lyrae!
Oris et argentum vestiuit pectoris auro,
Niliacasque Deo praedo sacrauit opes.
Hic tibi emendus erit distractis omnibus vnus 15
Tanquam Euangelico gemma reperta in agro.

Deus coeli et terre qui te spiritu sapientiae et intellectus adimpleuit
vt in medio ecclesiae suae aperires os tuum, conseruet te.in resur-
rectionem veteris Christianismi et ruinam detrahentium tibi luporum
et onagrorum Christi aulam sub ouina pelle demolientium. 20
