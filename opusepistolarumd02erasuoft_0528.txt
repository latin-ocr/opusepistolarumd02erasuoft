LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1517

5 tum Latinis tum Graecis literis non mediocriter eruditus, aulicus

noster ac nominis tui amantissimus.

Scripsit ad me vt lineas

subficerem, si quae forent quae minus foeliciter essent composita.
Perlegi omnes cursim ; dum iterum attentius rem scrutor, quaedam
in prima statim fronte animaduerti: 11011 quia ferula mea digna
10 viderentur, sed vt tuum iudicium obuium haberet, si quid correctioni

suae resarciendum esset.

Ego prouinciam prosequi haud potui; tibi

onus incumbit, quoniam in tui natalis laudem scripti sunt, vt quam

candidissimi prodeant.

De ingenio autem hoc affirmare ausim, me

hominem in Germania similem huic reperisse neminem. Vale, et
15 me et Paulum literarum tuarum aliquando participes facias.

Rhetoric at Vienna in 1524, and in
1527 was appointed historian to Ferdi-
nand. In 1529 he married; and in
1531 was chosen to be tutor to
Ferdinand's children. His death is
involved in mystery3 for he left his
house early one morning and was
never seen again. His published
writings are mostly complimentary
verses; but he left unfinished a his-
tory of the war in Hungary 1526-31,
which was printed in 1762. His
movements may be closely followed
in BRR, EE„ MHE. iii, iv, OE.‚ VE..
ZE. There is a life by Bauch with
a bibliography, 1886, prInted also in
the Unyarische Revue, 18873 and see
Bocking, Aschbach, Gesch. d. Wiener
Univ. ii. 382—91, and Bauch in ADB.
Bauch suggests ingeniously that his
name ‘Velius ’, which appears after
his first visit to Rome, was adopted
by him because he lived in the ancient
district named Velia, at the foot of the
Palatine.

(† p. 1541), a converted Jew, whom
Erasmus had met at Pavia, probably
in Sept. 1506 (Ep. 549. 42), and
who between 1507—11 published there
various works in which he used his
knowledge of Hebrew literature to
reinforce Christianity. By 1514 he
had settled at Augsburg, where he
continued his literary activity and
began a Latin translation of the
Talmud at the request of Maximilian;
to whom by 1516 he had been appointed
physician (ΖΕ. p. 464). In 1519 he
engaged in a bitter controversy with
John Eck at Ingolstadt ‘de coeli
anima '‚ maintaining the existence
of a soul in the universe. In his later
years he was physician to Ferdinand; Δ
and wrote, besides an oration delivered
in 1529 at the Diet of spires to urge
war against the Turks, a metaphysical
treatise De coelesti ayricuzcura, which was
printed at the request of four Italian,
universities in 1541 at Augsburg. See
Wiedemann’s Joh.Eck‚ 1865, pp. 335s44.
