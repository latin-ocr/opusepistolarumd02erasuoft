526 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1517

iucundissimum est te tametsi damno nostro absentem conualuisse et
tarn paucis diebus tam multa litteris confecisse. Illud enim tametsi
nobis volupe fuit te quotidie videre, tecum ridere, ex tuo ore doctissimo
frequenter pendere, nobis tamen solis fiebat: hoc vero quod nunc tam
prosperis ventis percurris, sicut nemini potest displicere, ita omnibus
est vtilissimum. Ad 1100 longe nobis est gratius te absentem bene
quam praesentem male habere. De noua pecunia ad nouum Pascha
ad te mittenda magnifico domino meo locutus sum. Is mihi respon-
dens suasit vt dilationem vsque Penthecosten aequo ferre velles
animo; ‘ non enim moris est' inquit ‘pensiones nisi in fine anni
persoluere '. Sed eo tempore non feres repulsam, [non] quominus
possis ex sesquianno consequi statum stipendium.

Pro operibus Hieronymi statim mittam pecuniam, vbi ea 11110
miseris, etiamsi tunc non recepero. Si Mor-iam cum Hieronymo
miseris, remittam simul pecuniam cum reliqua alia. Ipse Guido te
benignissime salutat et frater meus. Precor vt magistrum Petrum
Aegidium‚ hospitem tuum suauissimum, cuius consuetudine tam
mellita reuixisti, meo salutes nomine. Et tu interim, doctissime
domine mi Erasme, bene vale. Bruxellae tercia April. 1516.

Brussels.
(c. 4 April> 1513.

[Epp. 518, 519, 521 reached Erasmus between 11 and 15 March (Epp. 551‚2).
As he had feared, it was necessary for him to go to England3 to receive
from the hands of Ammonius the absolution and dispensation granted by
the Pope. He left Antwerp about 1 April (Ep. 572. 15 and 16 nn.) and the
formal ceremony took place on 9 April in Ammonius' house at Westminster
(Ep. 517. 81, 2).

Ep. 565 shows that by 3 April Erasmus had not returned to Brussels
since his departure to Antwerp. On the assumption that the place-date
assigned to this and Ep. 567 is correct, it may accordingly be inferred that
they were written, or at least despatched, by Erasmus from Brussels during
a hasty visit on his way to England. This seems easier than 10 suppose
with Dr. Reich that he left such letters as these unanswered for two months
after he had received them. Dr. Reich’s conclusion, based on Ep. 565, that
Erasmus did not visit Brussels when going 10 England, does not seem to me at
ull necessary]

6. conualuisse] Cf. Ep. 526. 1.

7. litteris] Epp. 529. etc. replying
to the invitations from France.

12. pecunia] Erasmus· stipend as
Councillor; cf. Ep. 370. 18 n. This
is perhaps the occasion referred to in
a letter of 22 Aug. 1534 (printed
by Miaskowski in Commer's Jahrb.
s. Philoscmm’e, xv, 1901, p. 334), where
Erasmus accuses Barbirius of having

once intercepted 100 florius, being a

third part of money due to him from Δ

Charles’ pension. He seems now to
have proposed to write off the stipend
for 1516 as unpaid‚ and to begin the
payments for 1517 punctually.
Pascha] 12 April.

14. Penthecosten] 31 May.

21. frater] Probably Nicholas Bar·
bii-ius3 cf. LB. App. 155.
