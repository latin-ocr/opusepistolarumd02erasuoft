BILIBALDVS PIRCKHEYMER BEATO RHENANO S. D.

Mnmms‘n, vt arbitror, vir optime, intercessione *olim Conradi
Peutunger, amici communis, amicitiae iure te mihi conciliatum esse.
Eandem operam ac maxime in eodem officii genere nunc quoque a te
familiariter vicissim exigo ; audio siquidem Erasmum Roterodamum,
non absque honoris praefatione nominandum, Basileae nunc agere;
quem vnum ex omnibus incognitis notissimum mihi amicitia copulari
summopere cuperem. Quamuis enim gratiam Imperialem meruerim,
variorum principum fauorem acquisiuerim, hominum clarorum ac
doctorum familiaritatem consequutus sim, reliqua denique amicorum
turba belle mihi pollere videar, amicitiam tamen viri tam eruditi ac
clari non in vltimis bonis collocarem, sed et rebus preciosissimis longe
anteponerem. Tu itaque enitere, oro, vt amicitiam tanti viri acquirere
valeam, qua re nil mihi gratius facere poteris. Promisisti te
aliquando (in literis) huc venturum 3 ο si talem mihi adduceres
hospitem, qua beneuolentia, quanto illum prosequerer amore! Spero
enim ac animus spondet, me ex humanis non excessurum priusquam
illum viderim coramque alloqui detur. Amici igitur tui satisfacias
desyderio, quem nullo maiore officio demereri poteris. Vale, et si
quando reliqua ex testamento nostri humanissimi Ioannis mihi relicta
transscripseris, ad me pergant curato. Iterum vale.

2. Peutunger] of Augsburg (15
and collections still exist in the

Oct. 1465—28 Dec. 1547). He went

to Italy in 1482 to study law, and
visited Padua, Bologna, Florence, and
Rome. In 1490 he entered the service
of Augsburg, and in 1497 was appointed
town-clerk3 the missions which he
discharged in this capacity and in the
service of the Swabian League in all
directions—to Rome 1491, to Vienna
1506, to the Netherlands 1513 and
152o—enabled him to pursue the study
of archaeology by collecting coins,
MSS„ &c. His Romanae vetusta-tis Ἐναρ-
menta in Auqusta Vindelicorum et eius
diocesi, Augsburg, Ratdolt, 1505, was
the first attempt to deal with Roman
inscriptions in Germany3 and he is
also credited by Zasius with a profound
knowledge of Roman law. He was
made an Imperial Councillor by Maxi-
milian, to whom he was much
attached, and the construction of
whose memorial at Innsbruck he
subsequently superintended. In 1534
he resigned his appointment as town-
clerk and gave himself wholly to his
studies, in which throughout his life
he was assisted by his gifted wife

libi-aries of Augsburg and Munich.
See ADB. The famous map which
bears his name was bequeathed by
him to Celtis. His acquaintance with
Beatus Rhenanus had perhaps begun
already in 1510 (BRE. 18) ; and in 1513
he dedicated to Beatus an edition of
Paulus Gortesius in Sententias (BRE. 33).

19. Ioannis] John Kuno (Conon)-

of Nuremberg (c. 1463—21 Feb. 1513), a
learned Dominican‚ who studied under
Aldus and John of Crete at Venice,
and under Marcus Musurus and Scipio
Carteromachus at Padua. In 1505 he
was sent by Aldus to request Maxi-
milian's patronage for the Neacademia
(ΑΕ. 5ο ; cf. a letter of Aldus in Archivio
Veneto, xxi, 1881, p. 269). He became
an eminent Greek scholar, and in 1507
published at Padua a translation of
Basil’s De differentia οὐσίας καὶ ὑπο·
στάσεως, dedicated to Jodocus Gallus
(cf. CPR. p. 69). In 1511 or perhaps
earlier he came to Basle and worked
for Amorbaeh’s press, helping with
J erome (Ep. 335. 305 seq.); ancl teaching
his sons Bruno and Boniface, who were
