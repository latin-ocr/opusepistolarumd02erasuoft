[Ulrich Zasi or, as he styles himself in an early poem on the Nativity
(Stuttgart MS. Poet. 4⁰. 47, f. 183 νο), ‘ Udalricus Siguardus cognomento Zasi ’
(1461—24 Nov. 1535), was born at constance of a good burgher family. He
matriculated at 'hibingen 27 Apr. 1481, and after some years there returned
to Constance to work as a notary in the Bishop’s court. In 1491 he went to
Freiburg with the appointment of town-clerk, and used his leisure to study
law. In 1496 he resigned his post to become head of the town-school and
taught Latin for three years3 but his interest was for law, and on 11 N ov. 1499
he matriculated in the University‚ becoming Dr. of Civil Law in 1500 or 1.
For a time he had to be content with a Lectureship in Poetry, and it was not
till 16 June 1506 that after much struggle he received the Lectura ordinaria
legum, which he held for the rest of his life. His sturdy‚ if somewhat can-
tankerous, character combined with great legal ability made him an attractive
teacher, enthusiastically admired by his pupils, In 1508 he received an
Imperial Councillorship; and he was soon recognized as a lawyer of great
eminence. The friendship formed with Erasmus at this time lasted un-
broken.

His legal writings were numerous, but are not easily accessible; the editions
printed during his lifetime being rare. After his death his works were collected
by his son, and published in six volumes.

njus, also Philomela, Progneus or Aedos

About 1508 he studied in Paris under
Faustus Andrelinus and Aleander, and
after visiting Louvain, Padua, and
Vienna he travelled into Hungary,
Greece, Turkey and Asia Minor. In
1510 he had returned to Augsburg,
and after making the acquaintance of
Botzheim at Constance in 1512 and of
Reuchlin at Spires in 1514, he returned

March 1515, and vicar in the August
following. He was the first to teach
Greek at Strasburg, and was one of
the leaders of the classica] revival,
though his publications also include
books on music and law. In 1520 his
posts at Strasburg were taken from
him and he withdrew to Augsburg
1523-9‚ where he received a prebend.
