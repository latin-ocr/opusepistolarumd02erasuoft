182 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 5 1 6

According to Beatus Rhenanus (1v. 280) the task of editing Valla’s notes on the
New Testament (Ep. 182) suggested to Erasmus a volume of the same character
(cf. Ep. 305. 1ο); but as the work proceeded, when he had examined numerous
MSS. both Greek and Latin (ll. 52—5 ; also Ep. 296. 155, and p. 164), he decided to
attempt a new edition of the Greek with his own notes added (Ep. 300. 31-3).
At what point this decision was made is not clear ; perhaps during his residence
in England, where he was certainly at work upon the New Testament in 1512-13
(Epp. 264. 13, 270. 58; and Resp. ad ἱππ. 901·οηίοα1“ιί., LB. ix. 986 EF). On arriving
at Basle he began to negotiate with Froben for the printing ; and at the
beginning of September Beatus Rhenanus announces the conclusion of an agree-
ment between them (BRE. 4ο). It appears from Ep. 421. 51—3 that he expected
to find at Basle good MSS. which he would be able to send to the press without
further labour; but in this he was disappointed, and he regarded it as an
unnecessary addition to his task that he should have had to correct the Greek
text before it could be printed (cf. p. 164).

From his published utterances (eg. in a preface added to the Paris edition of
Jerome, Chevallon, 1533, vol. i. f0. †; Jortin ii. p. 543) it might be supposed
that up to this time he had had no idea of making a translation ; but that within
a few weeks of his arrival (Ep. 305. 222, 3) he undertook at Froben’s suggestion
to include this in his scheme (1v. 283-5 ; Ep. 421 3 Lond. xix. 91, LB. 746, 863 D 3

and Copenhagen MS. Gr. K. S. 95 Fol.‚ f. 182). But facts to which Wordsworth
calls attention (pp. 51,2 of op. cit. on p. 166) show that this is not the case.
A manuscript is in existence which contains Erasmus' version of the New
Testament (except the Acts and Revelation) side by side with the Vulgate in.
parallel cohunns, and written by Peter Meghen (Ep. 231. 4 n.) at Colet’s direc-
tion in the years 1506 and 1509. The first portion, comprising' St. Matthew and
St. Mark, is in the University Library at Cambridge (Dd. vii. 3), and has an
elaborat-e colophon dated 8 May 1509, with the corroborative statement that
Hem-y vn had died in April of the same year. The second portion, St. Luke
and St. John, 'is in the British Museum (1 Reg. E. v. 1), with an equally elaborate
colophon dated 7 Sept. 1509, 1 Henry vn13 and the third part, containing all
the Epistles, is its companion (1 Reg. E. v. 2) and has a colophon dated 111 Oct.
1506, 22 Henry vn, further corroborated by the statement that Philip of Castile
had been driven into England in the same year (cf. Ep. 189 introd.) and died in
Sept. (Ep. 205)—spaces being left for the precise mouth-dates, which were not,
however, filled in. The colophons are printed in full in the Cambridge Cata-
logue of 1856, i. p. 321 ‚ and in part in the British Museum Catalogue, Manuscripts
of the Kiny's Library, 1734, pp. 11‚12. Besides Erasmus’ version the MS. also
contains the Arguments to the Epistles, which he afterwards published, with
only slight modification, in collected form (Louvain, Th. Martens, Nov. 1518).

Another copy of Erasmus’ version, interlined with the Vulgate, is in the
Library of Corpus Christi College, Oxford (E. 4. 9,1o : Coxe 13, 4) 3 but unhappily
the colophons, if ever they existed, have disappeared. Though less magnificent
than Colet's MSS, the volumes are beautifully executed; and may probably be
assigned to the same period. They contain the whole of the New Testament,
including Acts and Revelation, and also the Arguments to the Epistles. An
examination of various passages shows that on the whole the texts of the Vulgate
and of Erasmus' version agree very closely with Colet’s MSS.; but there are
occasional traces of another recension by Erasmus, especially in the Arguments
to the Epistles.

Erasmus’ translation of the New Testament was therefore executed several
years earlier than is commonly understood ; and the whole circumstances of the
work supply an interesting confirmation of the influence exercised over Erasmus
by Colet, on which Dr. Seebohm has rightly laid such stress. In Dec. 1504

Erasmus writes to Colet of his desire to work at ‘ sacrae literae ’ and especially ”

of his interest in the Epistle to the Romans (Ep. 181. 24 seq.). In 1505 110
comes to England and spends most of his time in London; and in Oct. 1506 we
have a translation of the Epistles made by him and copied by Colet's amanuensis.
It is therefore not difficult to suppose that one of the first acts of the new Dean
(Ep. 181. 18 n.) was to lend his friend two Latin MSS. from the Chapter Library
(p. 164) and to encourage him to undertake a new translation from the Greek:
perhaps also it had been through Colet that the invitation had come to return to
England in 1505. For the lapse of three years before Meghen completed the
