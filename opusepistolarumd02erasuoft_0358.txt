332 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1516

458. FROM REYNER SNOY.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 163. Gouda.
LB. App. 474. 1 September <1516‘?>.

[The date of this letter cannot be determined with certainty. It plainly refers-
10 Snoy’s De rebus Batauicz‘s libri cciii (Ep. 190. 10 n.); in which the history of
Holland is carried to 1519 and there are two prefaces addressed to the reader,
prefixed to Books i and v, but this letter to Erasmus does not occur.

Snoy’s composition is alluded to in Corn. Gerard's Elucidarium, 1586, p. 50 (Ep. 17
introd.) as ‘elaboratissimae Batauorum comitum et pontificum historiae ’. As
that was written in 1514—15‚ it is plain that Snoy’s thirteen books cannot have
been then completed ; and also that this letter, which speaks of only five books,

cannot have been intended for a preface. It perhaps accompanied a copy of the
first part of the work, presented to Erasmus.

Wm. Herman’s ‘de comitibus Hollandiae fragmenta ⁹ (es. 1. 12) are mentioned
also in the preface to Book v in Oool’s edition, but with the statement that
Herman was then dead. The omission of this fact here does not, however, con-
stitute an argument for placing the letter before 1510, since Herman is also

spoken of in the Silua Garminum (Ep. 190. 10 n.) without any indication that he
was not then alive.

The composition of the Deventer letter-book ( App. 8) gives a strong presump-
tion against the early date assigned by Dr. Richter and Mr. Nichols; since
the range of the letters copied there by this hand (A) is, except for English
letters, 1514-17, and there is considerable probability that undated letters belong
to the years 1516-17. I have placed this conjecturally in 1516, on the ground
that 111 that year Erasmus was preparing to settle 111 the Netherlands and that
Snoy may have taken the opportunity to renew their former acquaintance]

REYNERYS GOVDANVS PHYSIOVS DOMINO ER-ASMO S.

SALvn, mi Erasme, doctissime dicam an eloquentissime ignoro;
adeo tibi Venerem cum Pallade, gratias orationum cum prudentia
rerum omnigena conciliasti, vt merito palmam eloquentiae 01111105
tibi conferant. Lubet paulisper hisce literulis interstrepere ; tu pro

5 tuo candore veniam dabis. Ego inter ardeliones vnus nescio quo
fato historiam Hollandiae scribere aggressus inter subcisiua tempora,
dum per occupationes licuerat, illam quindecim libris complexus sum.
Verum dum mecum habitans gnarus (sum) quam sit mihi curta tum
verborum tum orationum supellex, propriae inscitiae mihi conscius

10 illam supprimo, atque nonum (sententia Horatiana) vt prematur in

annum, famae meae conducibile duco. Impulit me ad hoc opus
sane operosum aggrediendum Guilielmi Hermanni nostri fragmenta
quaedam, ita lacera atque imperfecta vt Edippo opus foret; atque
de Bathauia ferme descripsit nulla. Primus liber nostrae historiae

15 descriptionem Batauiae elucidat3 secundus originem atque incolas

primos deducit; tercius describit Bathauica bella contra Romanos
