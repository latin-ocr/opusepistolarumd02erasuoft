Institutio Principis Christiani f0. αἱ. <Basle.>
Lond. xxix. 59: LB. iv. 559. (c. March 1516.)

[The first mention of the Institutio Principis Christiani, to which this is the
preface, is in Ep. 334. 17o-2 ; but as in 1 Erasmus twice states (pp. 19. 24-6 and
44. 3-5) that the book was not composed unt-il after his appointment as
councillor (cf. Ep. 370. 18 n.)‚ the passage 111 Ep. 334 may be regarded as an
insertion at the time of publication in A. So also with the mention in
Ep. 337. 88, 9. The composition was therefore probably begun after Erasmus'
return to Basle in the summer of 15153 but the printing was left so late that
it was not complete when he left Basle in May 1516 (Ep. 407. 6). The
colophon of the volume in which it first appeared is dated May 1516; and this
is confirmed by Froben's letter of 17 June (Ep. 419) announcing the completion
of the book. In it (a) the Institutio is followed by the Paneyiflic (Ep. 179), with
a separate colophon, April 1516 3 the concluding portion being the translations
from Plutarch (Epp. 272 and 297). The volume was reprinted by Martens,
Iaouvain, Aug. 1516, entire; but Badius' edition of 1 March 1517 (β) contains
only the Institutio and its aeeompanying Isocrates. In the summer of 1518
Erasmus revised the Institutio for dedication to Ferdinand (cf. 1. p. 39. 30 n.),
and Froben published new editions of α 111 July 1518 (γ) and. June 15193 but
after that there is no edition that can be regarded as authorized until the
collected Opera of 1540 (δ).

The Stuttgart Landesbibliothek has a copy of α 111 which the colophon
after the Paneyyric is dated April 11.1›.xv, though in other respects the book
agrees minutely with α. The page shows no sign of having been tampered
with, and I know of no other copy with this date. It cannot, however, be
correct. The entries in ΒΕ1·.ι of a Louvain and a Venice edition in 1515 are
erroneous]
