386] FROM URBAN RIEGER ΤΟ JOHN FABER 189

Oharles V at the Diet. On the invitation of Duke Ernest of Brunswick-Liineburg
he settled at Zell, and spent his remaining years in promoting the spread of the
Reformation in the Duchy. The collected edition of his works (1561-2) fills
seven folio volumes.

See ADB and the sources quoted there; MHE. iii; VE.; EE.; Schreiber,
Gesch. cl. Univ. sz'burq. A few letters by and to him are in the Basle MS. KA. 0.
iv. 5. 1. ff. 45 and 57, and in Wolfg. Rychard's letter-book at Hamburg (p. 209).

John Heigerlin (1478—21 May 1541) of Leutkireh in the Allgau was the son
of a smith, and hence adopted the name of Fabri 01· Faber. He studied at
Tiibingen and took priest's orders3 and then matriculated on 26 July 1509 at
Freiburg, where he was a pupil of Zasius and Reisch. By 1516 he had seem-ed
the post of Chancellor to the Bp. of Basle; in 1518 he became Vicar of the
Bp. of Constance and in 1521 Suffragan Bp. He was in general sympathy with
the humanists, many of whom were under obligations to him; and for a time it
seemed as though 110 might join the Reformers (ef. Bl. E. 35). His decision to
remain in the Church angered them greatly, especially as he at once declared
strongly against heresy; but it opened the way of ecclesiastical preferment to
his ambitious energy. In 1523 he became minister to Ferdinand‚ whose confi-
dence he soon gained and who loaded him with offices and honours. He was
coadjutor-hp. of Neustadt 1528-38 ; Bp. of Vienna and Dean of Breslau 1530 ;
Provost of Basle 1539. He visited his various charges with immense activity‚
and was especially vigorous in promoting the prosperity of Vienna, which had
suffered severely from the Turks. His benefactions include the foundation of
a trilingual College of St. Nicholas at Vienna University. He showed continual
favour to Erasmus ; and in 1528 sought to persuade him to settle in Vienna.

Scmpsu nuper ad te, clarissime vir, quo in statu res meae sint
positae, quae studia consecter, quid denique post tanta conditionis
meae discrimina sperem. Quam grata item mente tuam Doctorisque
Vuolfgangi beneficentiam acceperim, animo complecti facilius quam
scribere possum3 intellexisti tamen omnia mihi potius quam fidem 5
et gratitudinem deesse. Frater meus qui meas tibi reddidit literas,
aliud a te nihil petit quam vnam et eam perexiguam curam disqui-
rendi famulatus3 ferocientem iuuenis spiritum quem nostra indul·
gentia auxisset, haud magno negocio exilium et aliena increpatio
retundent. In hoc, si puero rudi quidem caeterum fideli tuleris 10
suppetias, iam alterum tibi fratrem mancipasti.

Fama est Roterodamum lumen illud doctorum esse apud vos,
cui te et studiorum et vitae similitudo iampridem reddidit con·
iunctissimum. Quapropter quae illum scire peruelim, tuae humani-
tati Doctorique Vuolffgango committam 3 quod ego ad tantum virum 15
citra decori rationem scripsissem. Credo equidem te non latere
quanto amore et benignitate plusquam paterna Dux Hernestus‚ illu·
