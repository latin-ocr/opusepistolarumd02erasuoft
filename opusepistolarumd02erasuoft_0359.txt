459. FROM WOLFGANG KoPFEL.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 135. <Basle.>
LB. App. 75. 2 September 1516.

[The manuscript date may be accepted, as the letter is probably contemporary
with Epp. 460, 463, 464.

Wolfgang Faber, or Fabricius, Kepfel (Capito) of Hagenau <1478 ?-1541) was
incorporated at Freiburg in Feb. 1505 as B.A. of Ingolstadt‚ and was MA. 1506,
B.D. 1510, D.D. 1512. He then went as preacher to the Benedictine abbey
of Bruchsal, where his religious opinions were already advanced (CPR. pp. 42,3
and 185-7). In March 1513 he migrated to Basle (CPR. p. 43) and in 1515 was
appointed cathedral preacher (see his preface to an edition of Clicthove’s Elztci-
datorium ecclesiasticum, Basle, Froben, Aug. 1517). He also entered the University,
becoming Rector May—Oct. 1517 and Dean of the Theological Faeulty 1518-19.
He published an Irwtitutiuncula for Hebrew in Pellican's Psalter, Basle, Froben,
1516, expanded later into a grammar (Ep. 556. 26 n.) ; but the projected lexicon
(l. 163) was not completed. Erasmus received support from him for the New
Testament (cf. Ep. 456. 1695, and had a high opinion of his attainments in
Hebrew (Ep. 413. 13). After some negotiations (cf. his preface to Chrysostom’s
Paraenesis prior, Basle, Froben, Nov. 1519, dedicated to Abp. Albert) he went to
Mainz in 1520 as cathedr-al preacher and Chancellor to the Abp. (see a study by
P. Kalkoff, 1907) ; but in 1523 he declared for the Reformation and withdrew to
Strasburg, where he had held the Provostship of St. Thomas’ since 1521. His
views agreed with those of Bucer, and together they framed the Confessio

Tetrapolitana of 1530. He also took part in the Synod of Bern 1532, and the
Wittenberg Concordia 1536.

See Baum's Capito und Buezer, Elberfeld, 1860, with a bibliography 3 Schreiber,
Gesch. d. Univ. Freibury, i. pp. 97-9 ; and EE. Portions of his correspondence are
preserved at Basle (KA. C. IV. 5); and at Strasburg in the Town Archives
(Epist. eccl. S. xvi) and the Archives of St. Thomas (Buceriana, 21. 1-2).]

VVOLPHANGVS FABER ERASMO Ro. S. D.

REc'm valeo, maxime Erasme, si est recte valere tristius pati desy-
derium desyderatissimi Erasmi ; quo sine nihil amabile, nihil vspiam
iucundum bonarum litterarum candidatis, et iis potissimum quibus
illicibilis consuetudo tua mellitaque alloquia contigerunt. Sed et
mihi omnium maxime dolet absentia tua, cui de praesentia idoneum 5
fructum capere negocia prohibuerunt aduersaque valetudo. Iamque
receptis viribus videnti tranquillum spem reditus tui fortuna sub-
ripuit et fauor et principum magnatumque largitas effusissima
