292 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1516

to absolve him expressly from his disqualifications, for use in ease objections
should be raised which might make it impossible for him to hold his peace.

The course of events may therefore be explained in the following way : that
when he was about to receive his Courtray prebend (Ep. 436) and had a hope
of further preferment (Ep. 475. 4 n.), it was once more (cf. Ep. 517. 7 n.)
necessary for him to get the bar of illegitimacy removed—a bar which for
some years past, as his consequence and reputation increased, he may well
have been endeavouring to concea13 that accordingly, as the possibility of
answering Ep. 338 offered a suitable opportunity, he determined to appeal
to Rome, and with the approval of Ammonius submitted a double application
on the lines indicated above3 and that at the same time he applied to have
a dispensation received from Julius in the matter of dress (cf. ll. 540-4 and
Ep. 296. 186-93 also iv. 131—41 and nn.) ratified or renewed by Leo.

But none of these motives is quite adequate to explain the intense anxiety
which his letters show to have the matter safely concluded. The sear of
losing the long-desired independence and leisure which the offered preferment
seemed to be holding out before him is hardly enough to account for the
vehemence of his language3 though Epp. 475. 10, 476. 16, 7, and 519. 6 show
that simultaneous application was made on his behalf from Charles’ chancery,
and therefore that the Oourtray prebend and the bishopric were matters of
importance in the appeal. Vischer is probably right, too, in thinking that he
had overstepped in some way the limits of the dispensation given by Julius.
His attempt to resume his proper dress on returning to England‚ as described
in Ep. 296. 191 seq.. suggests that Julius' dispensation had originally been for
Italy only; and the negotiation discussed in Ep. 226. 10 n. may have been an
unsuccessful endeavour to get the dispensatim] extended. Any transgression
in the matter would render him liable to penalties concerning which he might
well have been anxious. But for the true explanation of his eager longing for
safety I incline to the supposition which Vischer dismisses‚ namely that an
attempt was being made, after his refusal of Servatius' persuasions (Ep. 296),
to compel him to return to Steyn; than which no prospect could have seemed
to him more appalling.

The chronology of the appea] may be arranged as follows. In July 1516
Erasmus wrote Ep. 446 in deference to suggestions made to him in Brussels
(cf. Epp. 438 introd. and 446. 16 n.)⁷ but took it with him to London, in order
to consultwith Ammonius as to the method to be followed. The language
of Ep. 446. 34 seq. implies that it was accompanied by another and larger
application3 which may be taken to be the letter to the Pope referred to in
Epp. 451. 8, 9 and 452. 11: and Ammonius’ description of this in Ep. 453. 13
as a ‘commentum’ makes it easy to identify this larger composition with
Ep. 447. As a result of their deliberations Ammonius forwarded to Rome
in September a packet containing Epp. 446, 447, and 466 3 and after some delay
an answer came through Gigli, who enclosed a suggested draft for the dispensa-
tion to be given (Epp. 498. 9 and 505. 4, 5). On the return of this to Rome
with suggestions made by Erasmus (cf. Ep. 552. 3, 4), the diplomas were
prepared at the end of January and dispatched from Rome about 9 Feb..
reaching Erasmus about the middle of March (Ep. 552) and enjoining him
to go to England for the completion of the ceremouy (cf. Ep. 566 introd.).
After the receipt of the dispensations the matter disappears from his corre-
spondence3 perhaps in consequence of the fact that Ep. 552 is the last letter
to his confidant Ammonius which has survived 3 but more probably because his
desires were now satisfied.

In some points it seems clear that this letter, as we now have it, is not in
its original form. Vischer is perhaps right in maintaining that the concessions
asked for and granted here are wider than those conveyed in Epp. 517, 18, though
the liberty granted in the former amounts practically to a release from canonical
vows3 certainly, as he points out, the readiness of Grunnius’ reply is quite
at variance with the long del-ay actually experienced. Mr. Nichols shows that
the name of Grunnius may be taken as a figment3 and there is reason to
believe that the passages about Dominican and Franciscan atrocities could
not in point of time have been written in 1516. It is possible also that the
letter may have been written in Ammonius‘ name, since Ep. 517, which is
the actual response to it, is addressed to him ; cf. also Ep. 483. 20 n. 1 therefore
regard Grunnius’ reply as fictitious‚ and have not treated it as a separate letter.
