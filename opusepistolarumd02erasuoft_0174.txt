ERASMVS ROT. IOANNI KIRHERO SVO S. D.

CVM ipse doctissimus tot habeas eruditos amicos, demiror cur hoc
a me tam ambitiose querendum putaueris, optime Kirhere. Quid
autem est tam arduum quod Maternus hospes meus non vel tribus
verbis a me impetret, si modo sit eius generis vt prestare possim ‘?

the offer of it was made at Bruges,
when Erasmus returned from England.
At the time he hesitated to accept it
(Ep. 388. 29 seq. ; Lond.i1·i. 5, LB. 352) ;
but subsequently decided that he
would. VVolsey, however, by letter
of 22 Aug. 1515 had then given it to
another (Brewer ii. 889, 890‘) 3 and this
news was communicated to Erasmus
in November (Ep. 371). XVhen another
prebend fell vacant in 1516, Sampson
tried to obtain it for Erasmus, but
without success (Brewer ii. 2066, 3573,
700 .
3 16.) nouentur res] On the resignation
of Chas. du Hautbois in 1513, Louis
Guillard (l. 18 n.) was elected Bishop
of Tournay. But after the occupation
by the English Henry vm gave the
see to VVolsey. The rival Bishops
contended continually for possession
until the English evacuated Tournay
in 1518.
commissarius] Rich. Sampson ;
see Ep. 388. 35 11. His excommunica-
tion was published shortly before
7 July 15153 cf. Brewer ii. 672.
18. Episcopus] Louis († 19 Nov.
1565), son of Andrew Gfuillard, Presi-

dent of the Parliament of Paris.
When elected to the see of Tournay he
was still quite young, and he spent
the years 1513-17 at the College of
Navarre in Paris (Launoi, Nauarr.
wmn. hist. pp. 232 and 737-9), under
the tutorship of Jodocus Clicthove.
He made his entry into Tournay at
length on 13 Feb. 1519, and during
his tenure of the see was a patron of
learning. Lud. Blaublomme dedi-
cated to him an edition of Gregory
the Great, Paris, Chevallon, 14 Feb.
15233 and the prefaces of many of
Clicthove’s works bear his name3 cf.
Bibliotheca Belssica and GC„ also Lond.
xiv. 17, LB. 578. In 1525 he was
translated to Chartres, in 1553 to
Chalon-sur-Saone, and in 1560 to
Scnlis.

21. Epigrammata tua] Probably not ἡ

the volume mentioned in Ep. 218
int1·od.‚ which contains only a few
epigrams. Erasmus was perhaps con-
templating a joint volume such as he
afterwards published with More; cf.
Ep. 550 introd. Most of the new epi-
grams included there had already
been composed by this time.
