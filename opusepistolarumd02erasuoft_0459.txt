[An autograph rough-draft, evidently of a first letter, in the Dresden State
Archives (Loc. 10300, Religionszwiespalt 1521-45‚ f. 180); printed first by
J. K. Seidemann, Die Reformationszeit in Sachsen. 1846-8‚ ii, p. 69, and recently
by F. Gess in Aleten und Briejk zur Kirchenpolz'tik Herzog] Georqs υοη sachsen, 1905,

¹³12} 3513e3i⁶se date is impossible3 but Lippert shows (ADB. 42. 118) that

de Wertern was in the train of Maximilian in the winter of 1516-17‚ and
that therefore this letter may be conjecturally placed at this period. Duke
Georgo (27 Aug. 1471—17 Apr. 1539) may have composed it as soon as it was
determined that de Wertern should follow Maximilian to the Netherlands in
‘the spring; or it may have been suggested by a reference to Erasmus in one of
de Wertern’s despatches after his arrival: in which case it should be placed
somewhat later. Maximilian was in the Netherlands 14 Jan.—1 June 1517,
and was frequently in Antwerp and Brussels during February and March
(v. Kraus), so that de Wertern must have had many opportunities to delivei·
this letter: but Gess remarks that there is no reference to it in Ep. 586, and
that therefore he may have failed to do so.]

cvm de te fama ad me peruenit, quam supereminens omnes Alma-
nos ceterasque naciones tum sciencia cum doctrina folgeas ita vtt tu
prae omnibus lumen mundi merito dici possis, indies animus creuit
tantum videre de quo talia dicuntur 3 vt et visus hoc frueretur pabulo
quo auditus iam dudum refectus est. Sed quia oportunitas mihi vs-
que huc data non est vt scirem vbi maneres, te visitare non valui.
Nunc autem te per inclitum Teodericum de Wertern, iurium docto·
rem, subditum et familiarem meum, hiisque meis inpolitis litteris
hacque cruda Latinitate mea te visitare non erubesco. Hic tibi
asseret affectum summumque desiderium meum3 huic credas rogo,
nec frustra eum de te mittas. Vale filiciter.
