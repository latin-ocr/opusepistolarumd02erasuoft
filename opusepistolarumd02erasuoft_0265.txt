409] FROM WILLIBALD PIRCKHEIMER 239

respondeam, quandoquidem a me quotidie per literas quid Erasmus 20

noster agat, anxie perquirunt. Vide, mi Erasme, quam auidi rerum
tuarum, ne dicam ingrati, simus. qui cum immensa et maiora quarn
expectare potuissemus praestiteris, et vltra quid querimus et quodam-
modo exigimus, Verum id virtuti tuae, non vicio nostro, acceptum
referas, et bene valeas, gloria et splendor humani generis.

Ex Nurenberg 20 Maii 1516.

Salutat te iterum stabius, Caesaris historiographus, vir doctus et
bonus. Salutant te gemine meae sorores Abbatissa sanctae Clarae vna,
et altera eiusdem regulae sectatrix, quae assidue tua scripta manibus
retinent. Maxime vero iam Nouo oblectantur Testamento ; quo mire
afficiuntur mulieres multis viris, qui sibi scioli videntur, doctiores.
Scriberent ad te Latine, nisi indignas suas existimarent litteras.

[The group of letters, Epp. 410-17⁷ from similarity of subjeets and language
were plainly written within a few days. The year-date 1516 is supplied from
the publication of the books mentioned. It is noticeable that the assigned
year-dates (most of which are added in H) are very various, and that none
of them is correct.

27. Stabius] John Stab (†1 Jan. 1522)
of Steyer in Upper Austria‚ after
studying at Schlettstadt and Ingol-
stadt, became Professor of Mathematics
at Vienna in 1497. In 1502 Celtis
crowned him as poet laureate. From
1503 onwards he was historian to
Maximilian, who engaged him to write
a history of Austria (not completed)
and to make researches into the
Hapsburg genealogy. He used the
opportunities thus given to search for
MSS. (cf. BRE. 24 and SE. 126); but
his principal achievements were in
the field of mathematies. In 1515 he
published with Diirer a map of the
world. At his death he was Dean of
St. Stephen’s at Vienna.

28. sorores] Charitas (21 March
1466-19 Aug. 1532) entered the eon-
vent of St. Clara at Nuremberg c.
12 May 1478 and became Abbess
20 Dec. 1503. She was a friend of
many learned men, and ruled her
house with great fortitude and pru-
dence in the troubled days of the

Reformation. See her ΒενιΙαιυίὶνάίᾳΙσείίεη,
ed. C. Ho'fler, in quellensammlunqfisrcink.
Gesch. iv. Bamberg, 1853. Willibald
dedicated to her a translation from
Plutarch, 3ο June 1513 (Ep. 362.
3 n.), and an edition of Fulgentius,
Hagenau, Anshelm, 1520.

Another sister, Clara (1478—1533),
entered the convent in 14943 and
in 1513 two daughters of Willibald,
Catharine (†1563) and Crescentia. To
Clara he addressed an edition of Nilus'
Sententiae morales, Nuremberg, Peyp, c.
Dec. 1516 (5³), and she is associated in
the dedication of Fulgentius. She
succeeded Charitas as Abbess, but died
after seventeen weeks of office; and
was succeeded by her niece Catharine
(Hefler, op. cit.‚ Anhang).

Among the MSS. of the 'I'own
Library at Nuremberg are some Latin
letters written by Charitas and Clara.
A few by Charitas were printed in a
volume entitled Epistola doctoris Scheurli
acl Char-itatem, &c.‚ Nuremberg, Peyp,
April 1515 3 reprinted in P.
