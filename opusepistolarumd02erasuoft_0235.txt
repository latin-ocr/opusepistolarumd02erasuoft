[This letter and its answer are found in Book 2 of Ellenbog's correspondence
(a) at Stuttgart. The copy preserved in the Deventer Letter-book (B), though
corrupt in one place (1. 3), represents the version actually sent, and its readings
may therefore be accepted in cases of marked difference; but in spelling I
have given precedence to α. Ellenbog’s correspondence is arranged in roughly
chronological order, so that confirmation of the date, which tho contents of
the letter amply supply, is unnecessary.

Nich. Ellenbog (18 March 1480 or 1481—6 June 1543) was the son of Ulrich
Ellenbog‚ sometime Lecturer in Medicine at Ingolstadt. After schooling at
Memmingem 111 1497 he entered the Bursa Wenck at Heidelberg, where he
became acquainted with Wimpfeling and Oecolampadius. In 1502 he went
to Cracow, but after studying astronomy there for a short time (cf. Vienna MS.
4756, ff. 151-60), migrated to Montpellier, with the intention of reading medicine
like his father. In 1503, in fulfilment of a vow made during an attack of plague,
he entered the Benedictine house of Ottobeuren, near Memmingen. After
a year of noviciate he made his profession 011 15 Aug. 1504, and was ordained
subdeacon in Sept. 1505, and priest on 19 Apr. 1506. He was prior of the
monastery 1508—12, and steward 1512-223 after which he was released from
office and allowed to pursue the studies, principally Greek and. Hebrew and
astronomy, in which he delighted.

His correspondence gives a pleasing and intimate picture of monastic life,
with much detail about the Peasants’ Revolt, and well deserves publication.
It consists of eight books, each containing 100 letters, and a ninth unfinished ε
all copied by his own hand. The first two, which were lost to Ellenbog in the
Peasants’ Revolt, are now in the Stuttgart Landosbiblio‘chek, MS. Hist. Q. 99:
the remainder are at Paris, Bibl. Nationale, Ms. Lat. 8643. The letters to
Wolfgang Rychard of Ulm are copied also in Rychard’s Letter-book3 a MS.
of the Town Library at Hamburg‚ 49 Quarto in the Uffenbach-Wolf collection. ,
