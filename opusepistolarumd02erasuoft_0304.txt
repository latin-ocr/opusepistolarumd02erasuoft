278 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 51 6

ing references to himself‚——if these were not added at the time of publication
(cf. 1. 3 n.) ; and that in pleasure at finding Dorp’s opinions changed on some
of the subjects which they had debated in their correspondence of 1514—15 (cf.
Ep. 304. 92 n.) he wrote this note for Paludanus to carry back to Louvain 3 having
previously spoken of the matter to Tunstall, who was in Brussels at the time
(Brewer ii. 2150). We should thus have evidence of the temporary reconcilia·
tion alluded to in Ep. 474. 18 ; and also it is perhaps more likely that Erasmus
should have written to Dorp in 1516, when he was not going to Louvain‚ than
in 1517, when he was on his way thither.

In favour of 1517 it might be suggested that Erasmus passed through Brussels
on his way from Ghent (p. 165) to Louvain (LB. App. 241); that the meeting
with Paludanus had occurred at some time previously (subsequent intercourse
is mentioned in LB. App. 241) 3 that Erasmus had spoken of Dorp to Tunstall
during their continued association at Ghent and Bruges (cf. LB. App. 241) ; and
that the letter was sent in advance of his coming, as an expression of goodwill.
For 1517, too, it is possible to suppose that, as in 1513 (cf. p. 11), Dorp delivered
this oration at the opening of the winter session on 1 Oct.‚ just three years before
his preface. But on the whole Ι prefer to follow Dr. Reich and Mr. Nichols in
dating 1516.

The oration was reprinted at Dorp’s request by Froben in January and again
in March 1520.]

D. ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS DORPIO SVO S. D.

Avmvl non sine summa animi voluptate, mi Dorpi charissime, quae
nobis de te narrauit communis amicus Paludanus; quanto pectore
in praefatione tua damnaris istos qui, neglectis diuinis literis, anxiis
ac friuolis questiunculis insenescunt, et qua tuba tuos auditores ad

5 diuinae Scripturae studia sis adhortatus. Macte animo virtuteque
βάλλ’ οὕτως, sic itur ad astra. Quaeso vt istam prouinciam tuo po-
tissimum dignam ingenio, strennue ceptam, fortiter obeas. Nos,
quoad licet, non sumus defuturi. Tu qui et aetate flores et ingenio
polles et omnibus bonis literis affatim instructus es, maiora illa munia

10 pari virtute sustinebis. Fauebimus etiam obscuritati nostrae, si ad
tuae gloriae splendorem nostri nominis lucernula velut euanescet.

Quae didiceram ex Paludano narraui Tunstallo Britanniae oratori.
Crede mihi, homo exiliit prae gaudio quod toto animo negocium hoc
capesseres. Demereberis tibi Christum, nomen tuum orbi commenda-

15 bis, ac studiosis omnibus rem vt vaehementer gratam, ita et saluta-
rem facies. Bene vale, Dorpi multo omnium charissime.
