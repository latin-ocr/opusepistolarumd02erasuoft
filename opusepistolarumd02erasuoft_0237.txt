Basle and he was able to transfer his work on the Letters to form a part of the
great edition which John Amorbach had planned and which in 1514 had already
been for some years in preparation (cf. Ep. 324. 28 n.). Ep. 308 suggests that
in so doing he supplanted Reisch,who seems to have begun work on the Letters,
but had perhaps not made much way when Erasmus' material was ready. Two
letters from Reisch to the Amorbachs dated 10 Oct. 1513 and 12 Aug. 1514
(Basle MS. G. II. 293 cf. also G. ΙΙ. 13. 90) certainly manifest great interest
in the undertaking3 and the prefaces to vols. v and vi testisy to his help in
gathering manuscripts from many libraries (cf. Ep. 419. 10 n.). To preparatory
work on the Letters by other hands, John Kuno, Reuchlin, and the Amorbachs,
there is reference in vol. iv. f. 34 v0.

The edition was completed by Froben in the summer of 1516 (a), the
expensos of production being shared with him by Amorbach’s three sons
and James Rechburger, a citizen of Basle, who had married their sister. It
filled nine volumes, the first four of which contain the Letters edited by
Erasmus, the last five Jerome's other works. The prefaces to vols· v—ix are in
the name of Bruno Amorbach, Basil’s being added to his in vol. v only. They
are addressed to the reader and are dated as follows: vol. viii 13 Jan., vol. vii
7 March, vol. v 7 May, vol. vi 1 June, vol. ix 26 June, and a supplement to
vol. viii 25 August—all in 1516. But the ascription to the Amorbachs is
perhaps misleading in all cases; for autograph originals of three of them exist
at Basle‚ two, for vol. ix and the supplement to vol. viii, written by Beatus
Rhenanus (Basle MSS. Gr. IL 13²². 1 and D. IV. 15. 272) 3 and the third, a draft
which was partially used for vol. vi, in the handwriting of Erasmus (amongst
the Amorbachiana, cf. p. 343).

of the prefaces to the volumes which Erasmus contributed, those to vol. ii
have already been mentioned (Ep. 326). Vols. iii and iv each have a preface
to the reader announcing the contente of the volumes ; dated from Basle 5 J an.
and 1 March 1516. Vol. i has a brief preface to Erasmus' notes on the Cataloyus
Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum3 also addressed to the reader but without date. The
only one suitable for inclusion here is the following, which is printed at the
end of vol. i and forms the preface to the whole edition. It bears considerable
resemblance to Epp. 334, 5 and also to Aday. 2001.

The edition of J erome was reprinted by Froben in 1524-6 (β) ; and there are
-subsequent editions by Chevallon, Paris, 1533—4(7)‚ to which Erasmus contributed
a short preface (cf. p. 182), and by the Froben firm in 1536—7 (ὃ), 1553, and 1565.

Of the MSS. which Erasmus used for his work nothing seems to be known.
They were clearly of some antiquity (l. 170 seq.) ; but though he refers to them
frequently in his notes, he gives no other clue to their identity. Aldridge
(EE.² 403 quoted in Ep. 281. 4 n.) speaks of having worked with him at Jerome
in Queens' College, Cambridge3 but as the old catalogue (1472) of that library
(printed by Searle, communic. Cambriclye Antio. Soc. ii, 1864) contains no MSS.
of Jerome, they were perhaps borrowed from elsewhere. It is plain, however,
from Ep. 332. 7-9 that the English MSS. formed an important part of his
edition. Another MS. of the Letters was borrowed for him from the monastery
of Reichenau, in the Lake of Constance, in N ov. 1515 (Basle MS. Gr. II. 3ο. 184)
by Peter, a Garthusian, who first at Freiburg under Reisch, and subsequently
as Prior of the house at Ittingen‚ in Canton Thurgau, took an active interest
in the work (Basle MSS. Gr. II. 3ο. 13Ῑ and 129).]
