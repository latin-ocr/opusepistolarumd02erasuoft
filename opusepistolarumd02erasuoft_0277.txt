FROM JOHN FROBEN 251

ronymi titulo quod Fryburgi describebatur in Cantica Canticorum
omittere cogimur: mutilum enim est; nam desunt tum in medio
tum in calce nonnullae pagellae. Excidimus igitur a spe nostra qua
sperabamus nos quiddam noui prolaturos quod hactenus paucissimis
fuisset cognitum. Imprimam tanta cura Moriam tuam vt in illa im·
pressione meipsum vicisse merito dici queam. Speramus hic omnes
tuum reditum, omnem tibi humanitatem exhibituri. Salutat te
Lachnerus socer et vxor, Gertrudis vxor ac tota sodalitas nostra.
Bene vale, compater dilectissime.
Basileae ex officina nostra xviia. Iunii Anno [1515].

420. FROM Bmmo AMORBACH.

Basle MS. G. II. 13³. 7. (Basle.>

(c. 17 June 1516.)

[An autograph. 1515 is at first sight suggested by the expectation of Erasmus·
return and by the fact that four volumes of Jerome were delivered to Warham
in June 1516 <Epp. 413. 34,5 and 425. 29,30.) 3 but for the following reasons 1516
must be correct. A rough draft of this letter occurs on the verso of Ep. 464 (B),
itself a rough draft3 so that the two are probably near one another in date. The
decision to reject the Cantica Canticorum (Ep. 419. 10-2; cf. the note on f0. γ* v⁰
in the index appended to vol. i of J erome) implies that vol. ii, containing the Ψευδ-
επίγραφα, was still unfinished at that date. Moreover, Epp. 419. 17,8 and 460. 1
show that there were hopes of Erasmus’ return to Basle in 1516; cf. Ep. 412. 57.

This letter is therefore probably contemporary wit-h Ep. 419.]

SALVE‚ eruditissime Erasme. ’Ά-γροικός εἰμι τὴν σκάφην σκάφην λέγων,
quare ineptissimas meas literas aequi bonique consule. Tomus ψευδ-
επιγράφων etiam felicius quam mereatur procedit, quanquam antigrapha

tot scateant mendis vt Augee bubile minore negocio quam hec re-
purgaueris. Huic, quantum coniectura colligere possum, ad Galendas

419. 15. Moriam] Probably the un-
dated edition (cf. Ep. 328. 48 n.) which
in Ep. 222 introd. Ι have wroneg attri-
buted to the autumn of 1515. For its
completion see Epp. 469, 473, and
perhaps 543. A copy in the Bodleian
(Mar. 860) has an owner's monogram
with the date 1517 in manuscript.

18. Lachnerus] Wolfgang Lachner
(c. 1465—0. Feb. init. 1518; cf. Basle
MSS. G. ΙΙ. 13. 102,3) of Neuburg on
the Danube, came to Basle c. 1480 and
in 1488 received citizenship. As
a bookseller and publisher he had
books printed for him by various
printers ; but in his later years he was
in close connexion with Froben and
managed the publishing branch os his
business. He died of the plague.

His daughter Gertrude († 1560)
married Froben as his second wife in
Nov. 1510, and became the mother of
Erasmius Froben. H·er name appears

in the colophon of Glareanus‘ Elegiae,
printed 14 Nov. 1516 ‘in aedibus
Ioannis Frobenii . . . expensis Ger-
trudae Lachnerae, vxoris Frobenii’.
On Froben's death she married John
Herwagen, who in conjunction with
Jerome Froben and her son-in-law
Nicholas Episcopius carried on the
firm. See Heitz and Bernoulli, op. cit.

19. compater] Erasmus was god-
father to Froben's infant son, Erasmus
or Erasmius, the date of whose birth
is not definitely known.

2.
3 4. Augee bubile] Bruno's lan-
guage in the rough draft is more
forcible: ‘Ne tu homo es lepidus,
qui mihi Augiae bubile (ita enim τῶν
ψευδεπιγράφων tomum appello) repur-
gandum delegaueris, quod ne Hercules
quidem omne repurgaret; tantum in
id theologici boues fimi congesserunt:
