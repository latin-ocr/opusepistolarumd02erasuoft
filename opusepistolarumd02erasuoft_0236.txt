FRATER NICOLAVS ELLENBOG DOMINO ERASMO ROTERODAMO S. D.

Docnssmss vir, quum certior factus sim agere te Basileae apud
chalcographos‚ non potui non ad te dare litteras, quibus vtcunque
animus erga te meus qualis sit scire posses. Legi dudum opera tua
incude faberrime excusa, quibus legendis oblectatus sum mirifice ; et
exinde nominis tui praeconem Vltro me constitui, dulcissimumque
iudico pro loco et tempore honorifice nominis tui facere mentionem.
Haec sane non adulacione sed vt [agnoscas] quo sim in literatos viros
animo, liquido agnoscas, ad te scribere volui, nihil inde quaerens
nisi vt inter familiares tuos Nicolaum tuum deinceps connumerare
velis. Caeterum velim certiorem me reddas de operibus gloriosissimi
Hieronymi, quibus vltimam esse impositam manum accoepi, vbinam
venalia inueniantur quantique vendantur. Insuper efflictim rogo
vt, si Nouum Testamentum, quod tu e Graeco in Latinum transtu-
lisse diceris, in lucem prodiit, vnum librum ei qui has tibi reddidit
litteras, dare velis, qui etiam pecuniam tibi appendet coram. Vale
foelix et me nominis ac honoris tui esse praeconem scias fidelissimum.

[Erasmus' interest in Jerome dates from his early years and may perhaps
be traced to the Brethren of the Common Life, under whom he had been
trained (App. 2) and who, from their zealous study of Jerome, were named
Hieronymiani. It first manifests itself at Steyn, where he was already quite
familiar with Jerome's Letters (Ep. 22); and where in composing a funeral
oration for Berta de Heyen (Ep. 2 introd.) he takes Jerome as his model
(LB. viii. 553 D). At Oxford in his (lisputation with Colet (Epp. 108-11) he
contended vehemently against Jerome on a particular question; in which
connexion it may be remembered that at one time his preference was for
Augustine (Lond. ii. 263 LB. 376). But a year later—and possibly earlier
(Ep. 67)—he had begun work upon Jerome, correcting the text and preparing
a commentary (Epp. 138, 139, 1493 cf. Ep. 531), the Letters engaging his special
attention (Ep. 141). In 1511 the work was resumed in Cambridge (Ep. 245),
where Dr. Gaius (Annales Colleyii de Gonuille et Gaius, ed. J. Venn, in Public. Cambridge
Antiq. Soc. 1904, p. 125) records that he lectured on J erome's Letters and Apology

against Ruffinus3 and in May 1512 Badius was negotiating with him for the .

edition (Ep. 263). But the work was not nearly complete3 there were still
many ancient manuscripts to examine (Epp. 264, 270, 271, 273, 281); and by
the time it was ready a fortunate chance had brought him into relation with
