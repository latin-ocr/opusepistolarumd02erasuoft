454. FROM anp MELANCHTHON.

Erasmi Epigrammata (1518) 111. v⁰ (a). Tiibingen.
Deventer MS. 91, f. 177 v⁰ (b). :0 August 1516.
LB. App. 119 n.

[This poem, which is Melanchthon's first communication with Erasmus, may
be included in this volume on the ground that its signature gives it something
of the nature of a letter ; and also because it is found in the Deventer letter—book.
The copy there, made by Hand A, is inaccurate in many ways z and Ι have there-
fore given precedence to the text printed in Erasmus¹ Efflqrammata, Basle,
Froben, March 1518. Ι have disregarded Hand A’s practice of writingi some-
times for υ ; and in some cases where both sources agree in an irregularity, Ι have
allowed it to stand unaltered. Kan's reading of the manuscript, accompanied by
a ‘lectio emendata ³. Erasmiam’ Gymnasii Proyramma, 1886, p. 1, reprinted by
Hartfelder, Melanchihoniana Paedaooyica, 1892, pp. 159.6o, is not always correct.

The poem was forwarded to Erasmus through Beatus Rhenanus (Ep. 556 fin).

Philip Schwarzerd (16 Feb. 1497——19 April 1560) of Bretten, north of Pforzheim,
was a great-nephew of Reuehhn, who devised the Greek form of his name,
Melanchthon, and gave him great encouragement to study. He matriculated at
Heidelberg 13 October 1509, and was B.A. 11 June 1511. In Sept. 1512 he
migrated to Tiibingen‚ and was M.A. 25 Jan. 1514; after which he worked for
Anshelm till 1516, contributing a preface to the Clarorum Virorum Epistolae ad Ioan-
‘ncm Rea-cmm, March 1514 (ME. 1), and taking a considerable part in the posthu-
mous edition of Nauclerus' Chronicle (Ep. 397; cf. Steiff, pp. 22,3 and 130,1).
Erasmus praised him highly 111 the Nouum lustramentum (ii. p. 555) ; and in 1516
proposed that he should go to Cambridge (Ep. 457. 55) 3 but nothing came of the
suggestion. and in Aug. 1518 he went as Professor of Greek to Wittenberg, where
his teaching was much appreciated (cf. EHR. xxii. 746). He was in sympathy
with the new ideas and was much infiuenced by Erasmus’ New Testament ; and
he took particular interest in Greek, publishing Institutiones Grammaticae Graecae,
Hagenau, Anshelm, May 1518. But under contact with Luther he passed

further and further away from Erasmus’ position, though the breach between
them never became wide.]
