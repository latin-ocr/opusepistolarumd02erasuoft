4404c3 To HENRY LORITI oF GLARUS.

Ott MS. <Antwerp.>
(c. 13 JuJy> 1516.

[A contemporary but inaccurate copy, in a German hand ς perhaps by one of
Glareanus' pupils.

The MS. forms part of a collection of letters made by John Henry Ott of
Zurich <1617-82), and now in the possession of his descendant Major-General
E. Renouard James of London. For Ott, who was Professor of Ecclesiastical
History at Genava, see Geneazoqical Notas of the family of James osAnstinrz’ars, by
E. R. James, 1898; the geographical work and maps by Glareanus included
in the same volume are discussed by Ε. Heawood in the Geoyraphical Journal,
xxv (1905), pp. 647—54, and E. R. J ames in the Royal Enqineers' Journal, Sept.
1908.

The letter is clearly contemporary with Ep. 439. The date at the foot perhaps
indicates the time of arrival in Basle.

Henry Loriti (June 1488-27 March 1563) was born at Mollis in canton
Glarus. After schooling under Michael Rubell at Rottweil in S. Wiirtemberg‚
he matriculated at Cologne 5 June 1506, where he was a pupil of Herm. Busch
and John Caesarius. He was M.A. 11 March 15103 and on 25 Aug. 1512 received
the poet’s laurel from Maximilian. As a supporter of Reuchlin he withdrew
from Cologne in 1514, and in May matriculated at Basle. Here for a time he
worked with Froben; but after a visit to Pavia in 1515 he opened an academy
at Basle, in which he presided over thirty boarders and wrote numerous little
books for their instruction. In 1516 Erasmus recommended him for an appoint-
ment at Ingolstadt (Ep. 394); and in 1517 gave him further support (Ep. 529)
when he went to Paris with the promise of a royal stipend. He carried on
his academy there, many of his pupils having followed him ; but the migration
was not altogether a success, and in 1522 he returned to Basle. In the Reforma-
tion he could not follow his friends Zwingli and Myconius, and accordingly
