124 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[¹515

345. To ULmoH ZAsms.

(Basle.>
<August init. 1515.)

Basle MS. Frey-Grynaeus, ΙΙ. 9. 135 (a).
D. p. 222: F. p. 172: HN: Lond. iii. 49: LB. 371.

[An autograph 3 from ll. 7, 8, 10 plainly written shortly after a return to Basle.
As it is published in D, only 1515 and 1518 are possible; and the reference to
the fiooded Rhine (l. 2) indicates 1515.

It presumably answers Ep. 344, since that letter is clearly Zasius’ first to
Erasmus after his return. There is, however, no mention there of any ‘gustus
operis' promised by Zasius. But Ep. 344 was written in haste ; and Erasmus
perhaps answers a message brought by Boniface Amorbach. In this connexion
the addition made in D to 1. 11 is noticeable.]

ERASMVS ZASIO SVO S. D.

DECRETVM erat, Zasi, vir numeris omnibus absolute, Friburgum
tua potissimum causa visere. Verum Renus exundans ita corruperat
viam vt natandum fuerit magis quam equitandum. Nos tui videndi
magno tenemur desyderiO. Sed ante omnia, mi Zasi, fac valetudinis

5 tuae rationem habeas. Nolimus hanc voluptatem nostram tanti
constare tibi. Nos, cum tua redderetur epistola, languor quidam
tenebat dies aliquot, periculose obrepens, simillimus illi qui proxime
nos coegit mutare locum. Sed gratia superis subduxi meei periculo.

1514 he was incorporated at Freiburg
on his Wittenberg degree. A poem by
him in praise of Freiburg was printed
through a bookseller-friend—Jerome
Husaerus of Bludenz—by John Schott
at Strasburg, 7 March 1515. But this
edition was badly executed‚ and in the
summer of 1515 he went to Basle‚
where he republished his poem with
a pref-ace dated 1 August, and also
began to work with Froben (cf. Ep. 358
introd.). By 1516 he was agam at
Freiburg, lecturing on poetry and
petitioning for a regular appointment
as lecturer, which he subsequently
received. On 15 March 1517 he
addressed a Carmen Pczraenetz'cum. printed
at Basle, to Philip, Count Palatine of
the Rhine. In the spring of 1519 with
many of his fellow-professors he fied
to Constance, because of the phrgue,
and was away till March 1520. During
his absence he published his poem on
Freiburg again with Froben, April
1519; prefixing to it a poem on St.

Lambert, F reiburg's patron saint. On
his return he contributed a letter in
defence of Erasmus to the Epistolcae
eruditorum virorum, Basle, Froben, Aug.
1520. In March 1521 he received the
poet's laurel at Worms. By 1521 he
had begun to favour Luther, and in
spite of University protests he was
still inclining towards the Reformers
in 1523 (VE. 349); but he did not go
far in that direction. The remainder
of his life was spent at Freiburg ς until
he went to Strasburg for an operation,
of which he died (ZE. 125).
