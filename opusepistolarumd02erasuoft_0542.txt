559. FRoM SEBASTIAN GIUSTINIAN.

Deventer MS. 91, ff. 97 v0 (a) and 214 (β). <London.>
LB. App. 249. <March 1517 ⁶.»

[There are two copies of this letter in the Deventer MS„ by Hands A and Β.
The latter has been so abundantly corrected by a contemporary hand that I have
divided its siglum into β’1 for the first hand and β2 for the second. The text of
α is on the whole the better; I have therefore given it the priority, correcting
it where necessary from β.

The date is debateable. Mr. Nichols places it in Oct. 1516, supposing, in
consequence of the error about the dedication of Jerome (l. 26), that Giustinian
had not yet seen a copy of that work ; but see l. 27 n. Dr. Reich assigns it to
May 1517, just after Erasmus’ return from England. The opening sentence
implies, however, that Erasmus had been absent from England for some time,
and as this is clearly the letter for which Erasmus asks in Ep. 584. 43, 4, I incline
to suppose that Giustinian was writing just about the time of Erasmus' coming
to England, that the letter was sent to Brussels and back again to England to
More's address, arriving after Erasmus' departure: and that hence he writes
to More asking that the letter should return once more to Brussels. Under
this view the Deventer MS. preserves, not the letter originally despatched,
but an undated copy from the rough draft. This was sent with Epp. 590 and
591, in response to Erasmus' request in Ep. 5843 and thus falls within the
narrow limits of time during which Hand B was copying for Erasmus.

Sebastian Giustinian (1460— 13 March 1543) belonged to a Venetiam family
which traced its descent from Justinian 11. After serving as ambassador to
Hungary 1500—3, and Poland 1505, and as Governor of Illyria 1511—12, he was
sent as resident ambassador to England, Jan. 1515—Oct. 1519. On his return
to Venice he was made a member of the Council ; and went as ambassador to
France in 1526 and 1529. In 1540 he became Procurator of St. Mark. See
his life, prefixed to a selection of his despatches, by Rawdon Brown, 1854.
Erasmus made Giustinian's acquaintance, probably in 1515 or 1516, and sent
him a copy of the Nouum Instrzmzeoztmn (Ep. 461. 3-5).]
