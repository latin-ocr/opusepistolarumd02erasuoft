446] TO LEO X 291

proditura est pagina quae Leonis optimi iuxta ac maximi Pontificis
praeconium non sit habitura. Non postulat hoc tua singularis 80
modestia, verum id debetur tuis diuinis meritis; et totius Orbis
interest tam Vndique laudati Pontificis exemplum in posteros trans-
mitti. Sin natura. nobis ad hoc efficiendum deerit, tamen ipsa
beneficii tui magnitudo, ipse huius pectoris tibi dediti ardor, ante
omnia diuinae istae tuae virtutes, ingenii vim ac dicendi copiam 85
suppeditabunt.

Bene valeat E. S. T„ quam Christus Optimus Maximus religioni
suae instaurandae propagandaeque ac subleuandis rebus mortalium
quam diutissime seruet incolumem.

[The circumstances of the composition of this letter have been sully discussed
by Erasmus’ biographers and commentators. In form it is an appeal addressed
to a papal secretary for communication to the Pope, on behalf of a young man
in whom the writer is interested : and it is followed by a reply in which papal
favour for the application is graciously conveyed. From what is known of
Erasmus* life, it is quite evident that he himself is the suppliant, Florentius,
and that Antonius is his brother Peter; and as the letter is included in H there
can be no doubt as to its authorship. Though it was published without a date
and not till long afterwards, there is ample evidence to show that it accom-
panied an appeal which Erasmus made to Rome in 1516—173 the first trace
of which isin Ep. 446, the last in Epp. 566‚7. The dispensations granted
as the result of the application are Epp. 517,18; and Erasmus' concern in the
matter and desire for its speedy dispatch are shown in Epp. 451—3, 475, 478, 479,
483, 498, 505, 539, 551, 552 : cf. also Epp. 412. 28-31, 421. 5, 423. 50.

The key to the purpose of the appeal is given by the dispensations. The first
(Ep. 517) is addressed to Ammonius, and absolves some person unnamed from
definite breaches of ecclesiastical law committed by him in regard to the wearing
of his canon’s dreSS, at the same time relaxing his obligations in the matter for
the future, and allowing him to live in the world3 and it also concedes the
power to hold ecclesiastical benefices, in spite of any disqualifications arising
from illegitimacy of birth. The second (Ep. 518) is addressed to Erasmus,
and after granting general absolution (without reference either to dress or
illegitimacy) empowers him to hold ecclesiastical benefices of a certain value
and character. The dates in both cases are the same; and the anonymity
of Ep. 517 is dissolved by Ammonius' subscription, in which Erasmus is
mentioned by name.

It is clear from Ep. 518 that one of Erasmus' desires was to be able to accept
beneficos such as were now being offered to him. But Ep. 517 reveals that
he was awai-e of certain disabling conditions in his birth (cf. Ep. 517. 7 n.);
and that of these he wished to say as little as possible. These two desii-es
were conflicting, and could only be satisfied by two dispensatione, such as
he actually received; one in general form, which he might be authoriZed to
employ without laying himself open to a charge of concealment, the other
