348 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1516

time hc is clearly ignorant (11. 13-6); probably made in a letter to Froben
sent with a revised draft of the De Copia (1. 13)—to include Ep. 462 in the new
edition : and that in his delight he at once wrote, as he had promised (1. 28),

a new letter, Ep. 473, which alludes to Ep. 462 and repeats some portions of
this letter.

This arrangement seems to me more satisfactory than that adopted by
Mr. Nichols, who considers Ep. 473 to be answered by Ep. 462, and attributes
the first paragraph of this letter to a promised dedication of the De eopia.
Dr. Reich dates Ep. 473 with Ep. 4903 but its close resemblance to this letter
makes so long an interval undesirable]

DOMINO ERASMO NESENVS S. D.

Domo, et quidem maxime, immortalitatem, quam tu vir vnus
potuisses praestare, praereptam mihi a nebulone quopiam insigni3
eam enim pluris feci quam decem Tagos, Pactolos et quicquid hic
mundus impostor admiratur. Moria nondum est excusa. Obstiterunt

5 nebulones milites, qui te decedente in Lotoringiam irruperunt, quo
minus chartas Frobenius recipere potuit bonas. Iam tamen sub in-
cude est: negligentiam etiam maiore diligentia resartiemus. Nihil
Francfordiae erat noui praeter Celium quempiam, qui ad imitationem
Plinii, si diis placet, historiam scripsit omnimodam. Lachnerus

litteras recepi) quam tu scribis esse meam; quomodo mea, mi

The repetition of this remark there
may be attributed to haste; cf. 1. 3ο.

4. Moria] Cf. Ep. 419. 15 n.

5. nebulones milites] Cf. Ep. 412. 5,6.

6. chartas] SE. 81, written in 1513,
mentions the cheapness of paper at
Basle.

8. Celium] Lud. Caelius Richerius
(c. 1450-1525) of Rovigo, between
Ferrara and Padua. After many
years of precarious teaching he had
been appointed by Francis 1 in 1515
to Chalcondylas' chair at Milan (cf.
Ep. 428. 34 n.); but this he only
enjoyed while French influence pre·
vailed in Italy. He did not enjoy a
high estimation among his contem-
poraries ; cf. Ep. 556 and Lond. xx. 53,
54, LB. 742, 750; but see also MRE.2
567, 568, 570. The book here intended
is his Antiquae Lectiones, Venice, Ald.‚
Feb. 1516, a miscellany of notes on
passages of the classies or on general

a separate dedication (cf. Ep. 556. 32).
The notes appended in his name to
later editions of some classical authors
are perhaps drawn from these.

For this work Erasmus accuses him
of having borrowed extensively from
the Adayia without acknowledgement
(cf. Αάαρὶα, ed. Nov. 1517-18, p. 15, and
the addition made to Aday. 1045 in ed.
Jan. 1523); and this is substantiated
by Ο. Orusius in course of showing
(Plzilozoyus‚ N. F. 1, 1888, pp. 434-48)
that Caelius composed the Pseudo—
Apuleius de orthographia. In a further

addition (Aday. ed. Feb. 1526, p. 16) ·

after Caelius’ death, Erasmus speaks
more kindly of him.

Crusius mentions a biography by
G. Oliva, Rovigo‚ 1868.

9. Lachnerus] Cf. Ep. 464. 16-8.

11. Francisco] Berckman3 cf. Ep.
258. 14 n.

14. scribis] Cf. Ep. 462. 4.
