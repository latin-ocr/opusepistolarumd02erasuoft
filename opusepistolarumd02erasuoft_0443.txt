loquor, vix ipse credas quantum Ecclesiae, hoc est omnibus piis
mentibus, consulas istis libris subinde aedendis. Sentio ego quam· 10
plurimos tuis scriptis persuasos atque inflammatos ad sacras litteras
et ad pietatem Christianam rapi, porcorum siliquis, hoc est ethni-
corum libris, relictis; inter quos me certe Christo lucrefeci, si Christi
gratia me a proposito vitae tramite non errare dignata fuerit. Mihi
variis negociis scholasticis distracto vix vacat semel atque iterum 15
interdiu librum aperire. Si tamen quid temporis occupationibus
illis suffurari possum, id totum Euangeliis et Paulinis epistolis
legendis consumitur.

Scripsit mihi Caesareus Oapnionem curare apud Thomam Anshel-
mum inprimi Artem Gaballisticam et philosophiam Pythagoricam. 20
Graecas litteras hic sic seminaui vt pueruli iam passim thematiola
sua Graece scribant. Vnum me torquet, quod barbaram istam
dialecticam extrudere adhuc non possim; nam barbaricam gram-
maticam olim eieci. Si quid Listriolus tuus vlla in re tibi com-
modare possit, vtere eo vt tibi deditissimo. Nosti animum meum. 2 5

Mirum est, domine Erasme, et tamen verissimum, nulla est nox
in qua tibi non adesse videar. Tota hac nocte vna fuimus Basileae,
vt etiam aliquid somniorum meorum audias. Tam est Erasmus
infixus praecordiis Listrii. 30

501. FROM GEORGE BURKHARD or SPALT.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 110. Lochau.
LB. App. 94. 11 December 1516.

[The manuscript date may be accepted, for the letter is subsequent to the
publication of Jerome (Ep. 396) and within tho limits of Hand A (App. 8). It
is amply corroborated by 1. 14 n. Bludau's suggestion (Die beiden ersten Erasmus-
Ausqaben des Neuen Testaments, 1902, p. 69), that this letter did not reach Erasmus,
is untenable in view of its occurrence in the Deventer Letter-book. The easiest
explanation of Erasmus’ denial in Lond. v. 35, LB. 425, is to suppose that the
answer to this letter failed to reach Spalatinus, who therefore wrote again
(Lond. xi. 23, LB. 278); and that when the fact of Spalatinus‘ second letter
(net the letter itself 3 cf. Lond. xi. 24, LB. 450) was brought to Erasmus’ notice
more than two years later, either he had forgotten this previous correspondence,
or, as is more likely, in saying that he had not heard from Spalatinus he was
thinking of the recent letter, which had not yet arrived.

George Burkhard (1482 —- 16 J an. 1545), of Spalt near Nuremberg, matriculated
at Erfurt in 1498, was B.A. there in 1499, and M.A. at Wittenberg in 1502.
Mutianus' influence obtained for him the post of ‘praeceptor ² in the monastery
of Georgental near Gotha in 1505- In 1508 he was appointed tutor to Duke
John Frederick (1503-1554)‚ son of Duke John of Saxony3 and subsequently
chaplain, librarian, and secretary to the Elector Frederick, whom he attended
to the Imperial Election at Frankfort 1519 and the Diet of VVorms 1521. and
