bach, near Vienna, where he copied
some mathematica] and astronomical
treatises by various authors in a MS.
volume now in the library of Corpus
Christi College, Oxford (A. 3. 103
ff. 1 and 124; inadequately described
by Coxe, 152). Ηο afterwards studied
at Gologne‚ where, as Dr. Herm.
Keussen informs me, he matriculated
18 Nov. 1506 and was B.A. 14 June
1509; and, according to the Oxford
records, he graduated B.A. at Witten-
berg also. At the end of 1517 he
went to England (Lond. vii. 38, LB.
222), and 'for a time taught More’s
children 111 Lond0n3 see a letter by
More, 23 March (1518 ⁶2), in Stapleton‚
Tres Thomae, 1588, Vita Mori, p. 230.
About 1 Jan. 1519 he entered Henry
vrn’s household as ‘deviser of the
King’s horologes' or ‘astronomer’ at
³620 a year; and in Oct. 1520 was
on leave at Antwerp, where he was
painted by Diirer, and where Tunstall
asked permission to retain him on
diplomatic service (Breweriii. 1018, 19).

Early in 1523 he was sent with the
King’s permission to Oxford to lecture
011 astronomy and geography, as a
Reader on Wolsey’s new foundation.
He was lodged in Corpus Christi
College, and erected a dial in St.
Mary's churchyard. The University
archives (Reg. H, ff. 83, 100-2, 104) show
that he supplicated for incorporation
as B.A. on 11 Feb. 152}, was incor-
porated 19 March, and permitted to
proceed MA. 20 March. This year-
date is apparently contradicted by his
statement, twice made, on f. 1 v⁰ of
the Corpus MS„ that he was in Oxford
on this duty in 1520. But 1523 is
given indisputnbly by the first 11110 of

Puerpera et meus parens te plurimum
Bene vale et me ama.

Ego te, vt nosti, amo.

the accompanying verses (printed in
Coxe); and on f. 66 v⁰, in copying
some verses written for the dial by
Vives, he states that he erected it in
1523. In Oct. 1524 110 was again in
Loudon, whence he wrote to Diirer;
see Thausing's Dic'rer, ed. Baton, ii. pp.
323, 4, with Diirer's reply, which is
printed also in Hessels' Ecclesiae Londino-
Batavae Archivum, i, pp. 3,4. In 1527 110
composed a small work on the calen-
dar, canones Horoptm·‚ which he pre-
sented to Hem-y vn1 as a strena for
1 Jan. 1528 (Bodleian MS. 504: per-
haps written by Peter Meghen).

Brewer shows him inspecting Cor-
nish mines in 1529, and sending news
from Germany to Cromwell in 1533 and
1538 ; and as still Henry’s astronomer
in 1545. There are greetings to him
in the prefaces (both addressed to
Englishmen) to Nic. Borbonius' Παιδα-
γωγεῖον, Lyons, 1536, p. 28, and Nic.
Prukner's edition of G. Bonatus’ De
astronomia, Basle, 1550. See DNB.
From his letter of 1538 (Brewer xiii.
ii. 179) it appears that he had recently
married, perhaps c. 1535.

Α portrait of him painted by Holbein
in 1528 is in the Louvre. His age is
perhaps to be read there as 42 ; ‘ quadra-
gessimum secundum,' not ‘primum ², as
usually taken.

3. libellum] Cf. Ep. 504. 2.

5. Theodericus] Martens.

6. theologi] See Ep. 509 introd.

8. abiisse] To Tournay, on a special
embassy to meet the Emperor. Brewer

Italian editions before 1500. For
Erasmus’ interest in Suetonius cf.
