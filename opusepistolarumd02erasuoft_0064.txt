Willibald Pir-ckheimer (5 Dec. 1470—22 Dec. 1530) was born at Eichstadt 3 and
after beginning his education there was in Italy, 1490—7, studying Greek at
Padua and law at Pavia. On returning to Germany he settled with his father
at Nuremberg, of which town he soon became councillor. In· this capacity he
attracted the notice of Maximilian‚ who made him an Imperial Councillor and
consulted him about literar-y matters. He served Nuremberg till 1522, when he
resigned his office in consequence of local jealousies, and gave himself up to
learned leisure. He had been left a widower in 1504 with five young daughters,
whom he educated carefully, and who afterwards became as famous for learning
as the daughters of Sir Thomas More. His writings include translations from
Lucian and Plutarch, a description of Germany, and a history of the Swiss
wars. His wealth and position enabled him to assist less fortunate men of
learning, one of whom was Diirer, who illustrated some of Pirekheimer's works.
Of these a collected edition (P) was printed in 1610.

See his Autobiograplm, printed with his De Bello Eluetico by K. Riick (Munich,
1895) from the British Museum MS.; and ADB. xxvi. 810-7. Dr. Reicke of
Nuremberg and Dr. Reimann of Berlin are editing his correspondence. The
latter has made some detailed researches into the history of the Pirckheimer
family in which the fate of Willibald' s library 1s tr.aced
