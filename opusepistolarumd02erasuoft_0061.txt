James Lefevre (c. 1455-1536) of Etaples in Picardy, the forerunner of the
Reformation in France, after taking his M.A. at Paris went to Italy and was
a pupil of Hermolaus Barbarus, from whom he acquired a strong interest in
Aristotle. On returning to Paris he brought out a Paraphrase of the Physecs
(Paris, J. Higman‚ 1492), and in the next fifteen years published a number of
philosophical and scientific writings drawn from Aristotle‚ Dionysius the
Areopagite, and Boethius3 his life being varied by journeys in search of MSS„
notably to Rome in 1500, to Mainz and Cologne in 1509. By 1504 he had
become secretary to Wm. Brkponnet, Bp. of Lodeve, a former pupil (cf. a preface
by Jo. Molinaris in C. Bovillus' Methaphisicum, Paris, G. Marchzmd, 30 J an. 1502&
also BRE. 430). In 1507 he was established at St. Germain-des-Pres by
Briconnet, who had just received the Abbacy; and from this time forward
his studies were principally Biblical, though with little Greek and less Hebrew
he was inadequately equipped. He published a Quincuplex manerium, 1509,
Commentaries on the Epistles of st. Paul 1512 (p. 14), and on the Gospels 1521 ;
after which he began a translation of the Bible into French,which he published
complete—the first entire in French—at Antwerp in 1530. In 1520 110 was
taken by Briconnet to Meaux, his patron's new see3 and whilst there was
attacked by the Sorbonne in 1521 and again in 1523 for Lutheranism, but
was protected by the King and the Bp. During Francis' captivity in 1525 he
was again attacked, and fied for some months to Strasburg, where he dwelt in
Capito's house3 but on Francis’ release he returned to France and was protected
by royal favour for the remainder of his life.

1435 is given for the date of his birth. For a study of his work see Delaruelle,
