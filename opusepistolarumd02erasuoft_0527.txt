Nec factum ab ipso perperam tecum putes
Iniuriaue vel dolo, vt dicunt, malo.
Doctrina florens animum illexit suum,
Qua facile tu omnes litterarum gymnade
Vincis beatus teque coelitum inseris

Beate viue, ter beate et septies.

548. 3. versibus] A Genethliacon
Erasmi, composed c. Feb. 1517 (VE.
ε’. 26), while Ursinus was at Miihldorf
in Bavaria (Lond. vi. 30, LB. 319);
printed in Ο· and subsequent editions,
and also by Ursinus iu his Poemata,
Basle, Froben, March 1522. From two
passages—
‘ Haec tum feceris antequam senecta
Tanges vndecimum grauante lustrum '‚
‘ Post quinquennia iam decem peracta'
—it appears that he supposed Erasmus
to have Just reached his soth birthday.
4. Velius] Caspar Bernhardi (Ursi-
nus) of Schweidnitz, SW. of Breslau
(c. 1493— 5 March 1539, not 1538)
matriculated at Cracow in 1505, and
at Leipzig in 1508, but took no
degree. About 1510 he entered the
service of Matt. Lang, Bp. of Gurk,
and in 1511 went with him to Italy;
where he studied Greek under Scipio
Carteromachus at Bologna in 1512,
going on to Rome in the same year.
He remained at Rome till the autumn
of 1514, enjoying its literary society

 

to the fu113 and on returning to
Germany re-entered Lang‘s service,
and with Bartholinus attended the
Congress of Vienna in July 1515.
He matriculated at the University in
the winter, and remained at Vienna

for a year. In 1516 he was once

. more with Lang, but did not accom-

pany Bartholinus to the Netherlands
on this occasion. In 1518 John Thurzo‚
Bp. of Breslau, who had been his
patron in his student days, presented
him to a canonry at Breslau3 which
enabled him to leave Lang and return
to Vienna. Here he worked with
success, teaching Greek3 but in July
1521 the plague drove him away, and
he took the opportunity to visit
Erasmus at Basle (matria. 1 Aug. 1521)
and Zasius at Freiburg (matric. 1 Feb.
1522) ; and before returning to Vienna
he republished with Froben in March
1522 a volume containing his early
poems. After a brief stay in Vienna.
he made a second visit to Rome; and
on return he received the chair of
