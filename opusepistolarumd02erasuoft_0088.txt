64 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1515

Scriberem tibi quo pacto Glareanus noster in aulam sophistarum, qui
disputationis causa de Paruorum vtilitate Logicalium conuenerant,

45 insidens equo fuerit ingressus ; nisi stultiora putarem quam quae ad te

scribantur, virum certe sapientem, si quisquam vspiam sapiens est.
Ex Moriae mille et octingentis exemplaribus non nisi sexingenta

supersunt.

Statim igitur denuo imprimetur; vbi poterunt addi (si

voles) scarabeus, Sileni, Gryllus Plutarchi, Parasitica et Muscae

Porro Lucubrationes tuas (hunc enim titulum

libellus in frontispicio praefert) euestigio Frobennius excudet‚ simulac
intellexerit non esse tibi integrum ei libello quicquam adiicere de-

mel‘eUe.

quam est a carceribus (vt aiunt) parum adhuc progressus.

Nesenus te salutat, qui cuperet tam esse vicinus metae

Si quid

55 comparandis Duncello vestibus aliisue rebus expenderis, id omne
dissoluturum Frobennius sancte promisit; qui tibi laeta omnia pre-

47. sexingenta MS. ε sexaginta LB. praue.

43. Glareanus] Though teaching
publicly at Basle with the title of
Professor, Glareanus was still only
a Master ; and the authorities had not
yet determined whether he should be
allotted a seat among the Doctors at
University assemblies. Resenting a
position among the Masters Glareanus
adopted this theatrical way of forcing
a decision ; cf. Schreiber's life, pp. 23,4.
In addition to the authorities there
quoted the following account is given
by Myconius in his copy of the Moria
(Ep. 394 introd.). ‘Memini tamen me
audiuisse a iureconsultis non infimi
subsellii, vt sibi videbantur, dum
publice disputatum est Basileae a
quodam bacculario theologo vtrum
Parua Logicalia essent vtilia‚ dumque
Glareani mei equus cui insidebat tedio
ex tali disputatione affectus (aulam
enim collegii magni eques Glareanus
inscenderat) foedissime cacaret, asser-
tum neminem bonum perfectumque
iureconsultum fore nisi qui sophisti-
cam calleret ad vnguem. Quid ergo
dicent philosophi? Anno 15.' f⁰ 11²„
against the words asininam philosophi.
Cf. also Epp. 463, 529, and VE. 141.

44. Paruorum . . . Logicalium] More
than one of the regular textbooks of
logic bore this title. One was the
work of Marsilius of Inghen, an ex-
Rector of Paris, who in 1386 became
the first Rector and ‘Founder' of
Heidelberg University (see Rashdall,
Universities, i. 441 and ii. 248); for
another see Ep. 447. 98 n.

47. Moriae] The first Froben edition
is of March 15153 not May, as 1 have

54. carceribus LB. τ cautibus MS.

wrongly given twice in Ep. 222 introd.

sexingenta] This form, which is
modelled on septingenta, δια, occurs
sometimes in Renaissance Latin ; e. g.
in a letter of Boniface Amerbach,
dated 1519, Basle MS. D. IV. 18. 350.
The corruption in LB. enhances the
rapidity of the demand, but is quite
without foundation. Even 1‚200 copies
in a month would be a remarkable
sale, the spring fair at Frankfort not-
withstanding.

48. denuo] Froben’s second edition
was issued without date, but with
a new title page ε ῙοΑΝΝΕε ἙΒοΒΕΝΙνε
LECTORI. ⁴ Habes iterum Morias Enco-
mium . . . ,' and on the v⁰ a list of
contents, to which was added Ep. 337.
It was not actually undertaken till
1516; see Ep. 419.

49. Scarabeus] This and the Sileni
Alcibiadis are two of the Adayia, Nos.
2601 and 2201. They were printed
separately by Froben in 15173 the
Sileni in April, the Sem-abeas in May.

GPrleus] This and the works that
follow were not printed by Froben
with any of Erasmus' writings. In
Sept. 1516 (Ep. 473) Beatus had com-
pleted his translation of the eryllus,

but Ι cannot find that it was ever -

printed ; he was still proposing then to
attach it to the Moria.

50. Lucubrationes] Froben did not
print these till July 1518 : perhaps
because Schiirer had an edition now
in hand, which appeared in Sept. ; see
Epp. 93 introd. and 342. 28 n.

53. metae] of Seneca.
