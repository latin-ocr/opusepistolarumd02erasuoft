164 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1515

Senecia quid sit ignoramus et post multam inuestigationem nun-
quam inuenimus, praeterquam apud Lyram, Mammotrectum, Catholi-
con et id genus hominum, qui super 1100 vocabulo bullatas adferunt
nugas. Senecio herba est Plinio lib. xxv. cap. vlt. Nat. Histor.‚ quam
Graece erigeron vocari dicit3 sed quo modo huc pertineat nescimus.
Porro Graecum hoc adagium φαγωλοίδοροι, quod item λοιδοροφάγοι, quo
modo dicuntur κρεωφάγοι et ἰχθυοφάγοι, planius intelligimus, et posset
Latine vno ac nouo verbulo interpretari, conuiciuori calumniuori‚
id est conuiciorum heluones, calumniarum voratores, quibus ora
conuiciis ac iurgiis iugiter opplentur. Et isthaec quidem iuxta pin-
guem. nostram Mineruam tute boni consule. Valetudinem tuam cura,

vt multis prodesse valeas. Vale autem in illo dulcissimo puero Iesu

[To this preface‚ which introduces Erasmus' notes on the New Testament,
a mouth-date can be approximately supplied from its position in the book.
As he notices in it some of the MSS. which he used for his work, they may
conveniently 110 considered here.

As may be seen in Ep. 384 introd., there is reason to suppose that Erasmus*
work on the Latin versions of the New Testament began in 1505-6. For this he
had two Latin MSS. lent by Colet from the Chapter Library of St. Paul's. As
nothing is now known of them it seems probable that they perished in the fire
of 1561 or in the great fire of London in 1666. For his first recension of the
Greek text, which took place in England, probably in 1512—13 (see p. 182), he
had four Greek MSS. ς see the Apoloyz'a prefixed to the Nouum Instrmnentum‚ 1516,
f0. bbb⁶ v⁰.‚ LB. vi. 1¹³. **2. One of these was the Codex Leicestrensis (Evan. 69 t
xivc) 3 which has been traced by Dr. Rendel Harris (Oriyin of the Leicester Codex,
1887) in the possession of Richard Brinkley, a Cambridge Franciscan, early in
xvi⁰. A second recension was made at Basle, where he had before him five
Greek MSS. (Apoloyz'a, ibid.), which are now all in the University Library
(AN. III. 11, IV. 1, 2, 4, 5 ; Paul. 7, Evan. 2, 1, Acts 2, 4.). From his account
of the printing of the first edition (Apoloqia qua respondet duabus inuectiucs Ecluardi
Lei, Antwerp, M. Hillen, (c. Feb.) 1520, f0. D·¹; Jortin, ii. 512⁴) it appears that
he had prepared a MS. for use by the printers,—probably IV. 1 (xvc) which
has corrections by his hand and red chalk-marks eorresponding to the pages
of the 1516 edition-and entrusted it to oecolampadius and Gerbell to see
through the press ; giving them at the same time IV. 2 (xiiss), the MS. horrowed
from Reuchlin (cf. Ep. 300. 33 n.). He soon found that his proof-readers did
not scruple to correct his text by this MS.; whereupon he gave thern a less
elegant one which he regarded as more accurate, probably IV. 4 (xiii--xiv⁶);
and in addition he, 01· they, made use of III. 11 and IV. 5 (xvc). For the
Book of Revelation, which proved to be wanting in all the manuscripts '
enumerated above, he persuaded Reuchlin to lend him a MS.; and as the text
