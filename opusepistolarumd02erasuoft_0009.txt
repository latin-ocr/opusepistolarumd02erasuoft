PREFACE v

contributions I am obliged to Professor Woodward‚ whose
Renaissance Studies are a lively encouragemenb to those who
labour in pubbing together bones that sometimes appear dry.

In conclusion I must add that most, of the manuscripts
enumerated on p. xi of vol. i still elude me. At this point,
it is of special importance to me to discover the present home
of the Codex Horawitzianus, the volume of Marbin Lipsius’
correspondence which belonged to Horawitz and which is said
‘co have been sold, after his death in 1885, to Rotterdam.

P. S. ALLEN.
