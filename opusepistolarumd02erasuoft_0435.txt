494] FROM FRANCIS DELOYNES 407

esse intelligam quam vt cuiusquam, nedum nostro, preconio egere
videantur. Quod superest, Deum optimum maximum precor vt ani-
mos istos vobis, hoc est tibi ac Budeo, noua indies proferendi, ani-
misque istis tempus in hac vita quam longissimum tribuat, vt 60
peractis quae promisistis, maiora concipiatis. Nam quae vltro spo-
pondistis, appellantur quotidie et flagitantur: ac iam periculum est,
vt Plinii verbis vtar, ne cogantur ad exhibendum formulam accipere.
Vale et nos ama.

Quum epistolam hanc iam iam obsignaturus esset Deloinus noster, 65
interueniens ego salutem hic Deloini ipsius consilio propria manu
adscripsi tibi, id quod hospitalis cuiuspiam tesserae 1000 tibi fuerit.

495. FROM GERARD LISTER.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 146 v0. <Zwolle.>
LB. App. 105. (November fin. 1516.)

[This and Ep. 500 are difficult to date securely, but as Ep. 500 repeats a passage
from this letter, and Ep. 5⁰4 repeats some parts of Ep. 500, Ι 111011110 to place
them all at the end of 1516. A possible arrangement is that before Ep. 495
reached Brussels, Erasmus had received Ep. 496 and had sent off Longioampianus
to Lister with a letter which Ep. 500 answers; and that then on receipt of
Ep. 495 Erasmus replied with a letter which is answered by Ep. 504.

Gerard Lister or Lyster of Rhenen in the province of Utrecht is said to have
been a pupil of Hegius at Deventer. He studied under Paludanus at Louvain,
c. 1505, and afterwards at Cologne (RE. 233). By Aug. 1514 he was studying
medicine at Basle, and contributed some Greek verses to the title-page of
Erasmus’ translations from Plutarch (Ep. 272). He worked for Froben, cor-
recting the 1515 edition of the Adaqia (Ep. 269) for the press, and also lectured
on Greek (Basle MS. G. ΙῙ. 20. 221). 111 Froben's edition of the Moria, March
1515, a commentary with a preface to Paludanus was added; and though it
appeared in Lister’s name, it has frequently been attributed to Erasmus.
The question of authorship is solved by the following statement by Erasmus
in an unpublished letter to Bucer, dated 2 March 1532 (Copenbagen MS.
G. K. S. 95 Fol., f. 172): ‘ Conuenerat vt Lystrius in (Monam) adderet scholia.
Quum ille tantum polliceretur et vrgeret tempus, quo viam illi aperirem, cepi
quedam annotare paucis ab ipso fusius tractanda. Quum ne (si)c quidem
prouocaretur et iam officina flagitaret exemplar, coactus perrexi donec ille
tandem apponeret manum. Illius ergo quum opus esset ex parte sentiremque
iuuenem 1100 ambire gloriae quo facilius emergeret, cuius humanitatis fuisset et
illum frustrari suo voto et mihi totum vendicare quod aliquanta ex parte erat
alienum ‘3 ³

In 1516 Lister was appointed rector of the school at Zwolle, and in spite of
opposition applied himself vigorously to improve education ; publishing there
with S. Corver Erasmus’ Sileni 0. 1519, some Disticha Moralia in a volume of
Ant. Mancinelli's verses, Dec. 1519, commentarioli in dialecticen Petri Hispani, 0. Feb.
1520, and De figuris et tropis. 1 Nov. 1520. Whilst at Zwolle he was accused,
without any just reason, of having poisoned John Murmell (†2 Oct. 1517) ; see
Reichling's J. Murmellius, pp. 123 seq. He contributed a lettcrjto Ezv. (BRE. 193) ;
