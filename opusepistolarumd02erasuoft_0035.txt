304] FROM MARTIN VAN DORP 11

In B² I have collated the variants and about half the text, and find that with
the few exceptions recorded here it invariably follows βῙ.

Jortin (ii. p. 336) prints this letter ‘from Von der Hardt‚’ but I have not
been able to discover in which work of that voluminous writer he found it.
It is not in the Hisl. literaria Refovmationis, 1717, from which Jortin cites his next
letter ; nor in several other of Von der Hardt's publications. The text given is
so corrupt that its variations are not worth recording, but on the whole it agrees
with γ.

The date is given by the reference in 11. 156-9 to the opuscula (Ep. 298).

Martin Bartholomew van Dorp (1485——31 May 1525) of Naaldwyk in Holland,
was a nephew of James Hoeck, Dean of Naaldwyk‚ the friend of VVessel of
Groningen. After completing his course at the College du Lis in Louvain
University‚ 1504, he became professor of philosophy in that College. He spent
some years in teaching‚ during which he superintended the performance of
Plautus' Aulularia, 3 Sept. 1508, and subsequently of the Miles Gloriosu33 and
c. 1509 he was appointed University Lecturer (BRE. 126). On receiving a benefice
(cf. 1. 161 11.) 110 began the study of theology, and in this his later years were
spent. He was elected member of the council of the University 28 Feb. 1510.
In 1515 on taking his Doctor’s degree in theology he received a Professorship in
that faculty and the accompanying Canonry in St. Peter's church ; and in
September of the same year he was elected President of the College du Saint-
Esprit. He resigned this office on 14 Nov. 1519, but remained at the University ;
of which he was Rector Fen-Aug. 1523. He worked with Mai-tens and wrote
verses and prefaces for many of the books issued by him ; see van Iseghem. His
own writings include a sermon on the Assumption, delivered 15 Aug. 1510 ; an
Oratio in laudem Aristotelis, 3 Dec. 1510; an oratio cle laudibus siggillatim cuiusque
disciplinarum, delivered 1 Oct. 1513 at the opening of the autumn session;
a Dialogue on the temptation of Hercules (c. 1514>; and an Oratio in praelectionem
epistolarum cliui Pauli, delivered in 1516 (Ep. 438). On this and Subsequent occa-
sions he was instigated by the theologians of Louvain (for whose intentioris, as
reported by Reuchlin at this time, see RE. 198) to attack Erasmus ; but in spite
of temporary disagreements (cf. Ep. 474) their relations remained cordial, and
at Dorp's death Erasmus wrote an epitaph for him.
