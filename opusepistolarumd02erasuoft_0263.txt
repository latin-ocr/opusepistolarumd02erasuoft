Q. p. 7. (c. 12 May 1516.)

[Dr. Reich is probably right in placing this letter just before Erasmus'
departure from Basle in May 1516. It has some verbal resemblance with
Ep. 407 ; and Ep. 406, with its repudiation of Erasmus* seli-imputed ‘inhumani-
tas' (cf. 1. 1 here), may well be the letter to which Erasmus had not time to
reply. For dating it in March 1515 the reasons are less cogent.

Boniface Amorbach (11 Oct. 1495—5 April 1562) was the third son of the
printer (p. 29). After some months as a private pupil of Conrad Leontorius
in the Engenthal near Basle‚ he was sent in the summer of 1507 to Sehlettstadt,
where he was under Gebwiler and Sapidus (cf. EHR. xxii. 743.4 and Basle MS.
G. ΙΙ. 30. 178. 9). In the summer of 1509 he lnatriculated at Basle, and as an
inmate of his father’s house enjoyed intercourse with the scholars who were
occupied in the production of Jerome. He was M.A. in Jan. 1513 ς and in 1514
went to study law under Zasius at Freiburg, matriculating on 16 Sept. He
inherited a share in his father’s press (cf. p. 211) ; but his interest was in law,
and he remained with Zasius, to whom he had become strongly attached, till
1519. In May 1520 he went to Avignon, where Alciati was lecturing, and
worked there until 1524, with an interval, May 152r—May 1522, when he was
driven back to Basle by the plague. In Aug. 1524 he received a lecturership
at Freiburg, but in Nov. was recalled to Basle to succeed Claudius Cantiuncula
as Professor of Law. After taking his Doctor’s degree at Avignon in Feb. 1525,
he entered upon his office ; and the remainder of his life was spent at Basle in
discharge of his professorial duties and in practice as a lawyer of repute.

He was one of Erasmus' most trusted friends in later years and served as
executor of his will. His collections of MS. letters and papers, the celebrated
Amorbachiana„ were bought by the town of Basle and are now in the University
Library ; together with the elaborate accounts (C. VII. 19) of his administration
of Erasmus’ trusts. They form a rich store of material for the literary history
of his time, and for the transactions of the Amorbach and Froben presses. In
his book of Horae (AN. VI. 36) he has recorded many personal and family dates :
that for his death is given in the University Regi-ster (AN. ΙΙ. 3, f. 196 νο).
