331] FROM BRUNO AMORBACH 67

under Zasius at Freiburg—see ZE. p. (152). Bruno 011 returning worked in the
press; reading Greek with Kuno (p. 415 in 1511, and also Hebrew (pref. to
vol. v of Jerome). After their father's death the three brothers retained an
interest in the printing-house 3 but their ostensible labours as editors are open
to doubt (see Ep. 396 introd.), and Bruno alone seems to have taken any actual
part in the work. In 1517 he made a journey to Italy to collect literary
material; but his life was prematurely cut short by the plague a few months
after the death of his young wife. Basil's name appears frequently in the
correspondence of Froben's circle, and some of his letters to Boniface have been

printed ; but his career was less distinguished than those of his brothers. See
Basle MSS. G. ΙΙ. 13, 132, 29 and the Amorbachiana3 Am. E.; BRE. 3 MHE. ;
VE. 3 ΖΕ. ; and EE„ in which a number of sources are quoted]

BRVNO AMORBAOHIVS ERASMO.

sava, doctissime Erasme. Nihil aliud quod ad te scribam occurrit
quam vt moneam, modo te monere liceat, vt quamprimum ad nos
redeas. Venies‚ crede mihi, expectatus non modo tuis, hoc est nobis
sed prorsus omnibus. Vale.
Basilius frater et Chunradus noster te salutant. 5
Raptim ex pistrino nostro apud Basileam prima Maii Anno 1515.
Tuus, quicquid est, Bruno Amorbachius.

332. To PETER GILLEs.

London.
7 May (1515)-

[Shortly after Erasmus’ arrival in England, which occurs at this time in no
other year. From the many delays mentioned here his departure from Basle
cannot be put much later than the middle of March. He accompanied the
party of bookdealers going to the Frankfort fair (Epp. 328. 39-41‚ 330. 15, 16)
where he had his second meeting with Hutten (cf. Ep. 300. 1211„ Sponyc'a,
LB. x. 16620 and 166811, and HE. 26): and thence he travelled to England
through Antwerp, Ghent, Tournay, and St. Omer (Ep. 327).

The purpose of this visit may be found firstly in the necessities of Jerome
21. 6 n.) and the New Testament (pp. 182, 3) ; partly also in his natural restless-
ness and desire for change of air (cf. Ep. 345. 6—8)‚ and partly in the wish to
revisit his friends and the patrous on whom, in the absence of the endowments
which came subsequently (cf. Epp. 370. 18 n. and 436), he was still dependent.]

331. 5. chunradus] Gonr. Brunner
(Fonteius or Fontanus) of Wesen on
the Walensee († c. 23 Oct. 1519). He
was a contemporary of Boniface

note on the same subject in Basle MS.
G. II. 29). When Glareanus left Basle
in 1517, Fonteius succeeded to his
school (BRE. 135, Zw. E. 1518. 1, and

Amerbach at Basle University (mati-ic.
1509, M.A. Jan. 1513), and afterwards
worked with the Amorbachs and with
Froben ; making himself useful in
their presses (cf. pp. 55, 114) and also
acting as a bookbuying agent (cf. BRE.
71, which is by him, and an autograph

a letter of Glareanus to him, in Basle
MS. G. II. 33, which perhaps refers to
this transaction between them). He
succumbed to the plague a few days
after Bruno Amorbach (Zw. E. 1519.
35‚6), meeting death with great calm-
ness (BRE. 130).
