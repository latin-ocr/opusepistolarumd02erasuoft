384] rro LEO X 183

copy of the Gospels it is not possible to account with certainty. Erasmus'
letters for that period throw no light upon the subject; but on the whole
I incline to suppose that the interval was due to causes connected with Meghen,
and that Erasmus had finished his work before he left England in 1506.

The dates in the MSS. also elucidate Erasmus’ letter to Richard Bere, Abbot
of Glastonbury, in 1524 (Lond. xviii. 46, LB. 700); from which it appears that
after returning from Italy Erasmus was introduced by Bernard Andreas
(Ep. 243. 52 n.) to the Abbot, and offered him a copy of a portion of 1116 transla-
tion, containing the Arguments, perhaps with some suggestion of publication3
but that the Abbot showed disapproval of the idea of improving on the Vulgate‚
and that in consequence Erasmus threw the work aside.

With regard to the date when Erasmus first determined to make his transla-
tion, it is not necessary to charge him with intentional misstatement in the
utterances quoted above 3 for all, except that from the preface to Jerome, admit
equally well of the interpretation that the idea of publishiny it had not occurred
to him until he went to Basle, but that he yielded there to the suggestions of
his friends ; and even in the J erome preface it is easy to suppose that in repeat-
ing towards the end of his life a statement he had often made before, he 11110011-
seiously modified it slightly in form.

After the first proposals in 1514 the negotiations appear to have been broken
off, Erasmus having perhaps considered that he might get the book better
printed in Italy (Epp. 324. 27 n., 389. 9 n.). But probably one object of his
journey to England in March 1515 was to fetch a copy of his translation ; though
he perhaps obtained only the earliest part (Ep. 334. 166, 7). In April Beatus
Rhenanus was again attempting to secure the book for Froben (Epp. 328. 36,
330. 1); and by the time Erasmus returned to Basle, 116 had decided to accept
Froben's offer. The work began in August (Ep. 348. 10-12); but it was interrupted
(Ep. 356. 11, 2), and by the middle of September not much way can have been
made, for Gerbell was still making suggestions as to the form of printing
(Ep. 352. 5 seq.). Within a fortnight, however, Gerbell and. Oecolampadius
(Ep. 358. 5 n.) were installed to correct the proofs, and withtwo presses at
work (cf. a letter from Froben to Boniface Amorbach, 16 Oct. 1515: Basle MS.
G. ΙΙ. 29) 1116 book soon made rapid progress; although the correctors proved
less able for their task than Erasmus had hoped (Ep. 421. 53-6). Just as with
the Adaqia (Ep. 211 introd.), the Annotationes (which are on the Vulgate) were
greatly enlarged whilst in the press (1v. 281-3 and Ep. 421. 5ο) and ultimately
instead of the 30 sheets at first estimated the book filled over 80 (Epp. 421. 63—5
and 377. 7 n.). The final colophon is dated Feb. 1516, that to the notes being
1 Mar. 1516: and although on 21 Feb. Erasmus was still occupied with the
introductory matter including this letter (cf. BRE. 57), on 7 March he could
announce that the book was published (Ep. 394. 36). Thus a folio of more
than 1,000 pages had been printed, and even partly written, in the space of five to
six months, A copy, probably presented by Erasmus, reached Budaeus in Paris
on 26 April (Ep. 403. 27, 8) and the book was on the Paris market a week later
(Ep. 403. 2811.) ; Reuchlin, t00‚ received it through the Frankfort spring fair

E . 18. 1 .
( Iimqrnedigtely after publication Erasmus was dissatisfied with his work
(Ep. 402. 1, 2) and began preparing for a new edition (Epp. 417 and 421. 70 seq).
Besides revising the Greek with new MSS. (cf. Ep. 373 inti-od.) 116 now introduced
his original translation3 which in 1516 had been considerably modified, with
a general tendency towards the retention of the Vulgate. For example, in the
opening of St. J ohn's Gospel the 1516 edition follows the Vulgate closely, keeping
in v. 1 verbum instead of sermo, which is found in Colet’s MSS. In 1519 sermo was
restored—a change which cost Erasmus a controversy (cf. l. 46 n.)-and through-
out the whole work the translation was brought into accord with the text of
Colet‘s MSS. : with such minute accuracy that even insignificant variations such
as et for ac or -que for et are invariably put back into their original form. So
thorough was the revision that a careful examination of a great many passages
has not revealed more than a few instances of a 1516 variant remaining in 1519,
and only two examples of departure in 1519 from the text of Colet's MSS. Of
this transformation Ι have not been able to discover any trace among Erasmus’
letters or remains, except a single manuscript in the bundle of J erome papers
at Basle (A. IX. 56 ; cf. Ep. 326 introd.). It is a sheet of two folios, copied by
Hand D of the Deventer MS. and containing portions of the Gospel of St. Mark.
