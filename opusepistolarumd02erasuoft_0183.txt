368] FROM PAUL VOLZ 159

By 1503 he had entered the Benedictine monastery of Schuttern near offenburg ;
and in 1512 was elected Abbot of Hiigshofen in the Wesserthal, near Schlettstadt,
in order to introduce there the Bursfeld reforms. By the middle of 1526 he
had gone over to the reformed doctrines—a step which he seems to have con·
templated before 1521 (Lond. xii. 33 ; LB. 490). He withdrew to Strasburg,
where in 1528 (BRE. 293) he was appointed preacher to the nuns of St. Nicholas3
but he refused to subscribe to the Wittenberg Concordia (1536) and on 13 J an.
1537 was deprived of his office. He was restored in 1539, after being convinced
again by Calvin ; and thenceforward remaincd in communion with the Strasburg
Reformers.

He was a member of Wimpfeling's Literary Society at Schlettstadt and com-
posed antiquarian Obsco-nationes ; most of which perished in the Peasants’ Revolt,
when Hiigshofen was sacked. He also wrote Chronicles of Schuttern3 for
which see an article by J . May in Zs. f. Gesch. cz. Oberrlzeins, viii (1893) pp. 256-88.
Erasmus dedicated to him the new edition of his Enelziriclion (Ep. 164 introd.);
and besides sending him a cup shortly before his death (EE.² 153) left him
100 florins in his will. BRE and EE. contain twenty-six letters written by
him ; see also Trith.5 p. 255 and Knod in ADB.]
