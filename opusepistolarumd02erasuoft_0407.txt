consuetudinem habiturus. De praebenda tua cupio tibi omnia recte
procedere. De episcopatu vero, cum longius distet et parum pinguis
habeatur, videris mihi in reiiciendo sapere, quum sit tibi, vt scite
scribis, onus videlicet absque subsidio, et oneri potius quam honori
futurus. Epistolas abs te missas accepi, quae me plurimum legendo
delectauerunt; nam legi quam plures, integrum volumen nondum
perlegi; quod vero mihi eas miseris habeo tibi gratiam. Ioanni de
Molendino de Hieronymo patefeci, nec displicuit ei nuncium.

Vale et me, vt facis, ama3 et si non sit tibi in animo hac hyeme
Tornacum visere, saltem epistolis tuis nos visere oro ne graueris.
Iterum vale ex Tornaco postridie diui Martini.

Honorando viro D. Cancellario me commendatum habeas.

487. FRoM GERARD GELDENHAUER.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 145. Louvain.
LB. App. 91. 12 November 1516.

[The date is confirmed by the preparations for the Utopia.

Gerard Geldenhauer of Nymegen (c. 1482—10 Jan. 1542) was educated at
Deventer under Hegius and Ostendorp (Ep. 23. 56 n. and 67 n.). He is next
found at Lorwain, whence on 28 Feb. 1514 he dates a letter de situ Zelandz'ae
which is printed in Dorp's Dialogue (p. 11). He had a hand in many of
Martens’ books, including Rud. Agricola's De inuentione dialectica (Ep. 336.
1 n.)‚ and also eomposed a volume of Satyrae, 13 June 1515 (a), and a Pompa
Exequiarum . . . Ferdonandi, 3 Apr. 1516 (b). The preface to the Pompa is dated
from Brussels and shows that he had then become chaplain to Prince Charles,
and had some tie with Philip of Burgundy, Admiral of the sea. When Philip
was made Bp. of Utrecht in 1517, Geldenhauer became his secretary. During
this period he composed a narrative (c) of Philip's entry into Utreeht, c. 25 May
1517, and a treatise De Batauorum insula, 19 Sept. 1520; and c. 24 Jan. 1517 was
crowned poet laureate by Maximilian at Tirlemont. On Philip’s death, 7 Apr.
1524, he entered the service of Maximilian of Burgundy, Abbot of Middelburg‚
who in Sept. 1525 sent him on a mission to Wittenberg ; see his Itinerarium (d).
Shortly after this he definitely went over to the Reformers. After marrying in
1527, he settled as a private teacher at Strasburg3 whence in 1531 he moved to
Augsburg, to be rector of a school. In 1532 he was appointed Professor of
History at Marburg3 and there he remained till his death, taking an active
part in the development of the Reformation. His most important works in
this period are a life of Philip of Burgundy, strasburg, Chr. Aegenolph,
March 1529 (e) ; and an Institutio Scholae Christianae, Frankfort, Chr. Aegenolph,
Sept. 15 4.

Unti131520, and probably later, he was on very friendly terms with Erasmus ;
but in 1529 there was an estrangement between them, because he published
at Strasburg some excerpts from Erasmus' writings accompanied by some
‘Evangelical ' letters of his own (f). By Sept. 1536, however, when Geldenhauer
contributed lives of Agricola and Wessel to Fichard’s Vitae illustrium virorum, no
trace of ill feeling remains.
