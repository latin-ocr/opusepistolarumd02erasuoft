479433 FROM ANDREW AMMONIUS.

Paris MS. NouV. aeq. lat. 1520. 3. London.
22 October (1516).

[An autograph in the Bibliotheque Nationale‚ acqui1ed, as M. Omont kindly
informs me, in May 1882. It evidently belonged at one time to the Basle
University Library and formed part of the series of documents about Erasmus’
dispensation from the Pope which is still preserved there and which now com-
mences with Epp. 466 and 498. For like the latter it is endorsed ‘Manus
Andreae Ammonii' by Erasmus’ own hand3 and also a copy of it is found
in a collection of letters still in the Basle Library (G2. ΙΙ. 67), which are all
written by one xviii⁰ hand, and are for the most part copies of just these same
letters about the dispensation and of others of which the originals are still kept
together at Basle.

It is well known that in Dec. 1841 a number of autographs were exchanged
out of the anle Library for others which it was desired to acquire. The same
collection of copies, Gr.2 ΙΙ. 67, includes two letters of which the autographs are
now in the collection bequeathed by M. Labouchere (cf. Ep. 537 introd.) to the
Departmental Library at Nantes, and one of which I have not yet been able to
trace the original. The Labouchere collection also possesses Boniface Amerbach’s
autograph of the Sententt'a Arbitrorum (LB. App. 346 fin.)‚ which was purchased at
the Succi sale in May 18693 and of which a copy (by Buxtorf) is preserved
at Basle. It therefore seems clear that these four letters copied in G.² ΙΙ. 67
and the Sententia passed out of the Basle Library with the others in 1841.

Before parting with the autographs the Regents responsible for the exchange
had them copied, inadequately, by Buxtorf‚ who was then Librarian. The fact
that two out of these four letters in G.² ΙΙ. 67 were not recopied (that any were
recopied was perhaps an oversight‚ for the collection is large) in 1841 ‘ ex
decreto Regentium ¹, suggests that the collection was then known to the authori-
ties of the Library ς by 1876, when Vischer printed his Erasmz‘ana, its existence
must have been forgotten, since he omits to print this letter. which is of interest
and importance in the series he discusses. It was first printed by E. G. Ledos
in the Reme des Βίόῑίοίὴὲραεε, 1897, p. 169, from the original.]
