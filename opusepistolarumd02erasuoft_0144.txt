N icholas Gerbell of Pforzheim (c. 1485—0. 20 Jan. 1560) was studying at
Vienna under Celtis 6. 1502 (VR. sl. 17). On 16 June 1506 he matriculated at
Cologne. whence he corresponded with Trithemius in June 1507 (TE). In 1508
he was M.A. at 'I'iibingen and in 1510 was studying Aquinas in the Dominican
college there3 but nevertheless he was an admirer (RE. 98) and supporter of
Reuchlin in his contest with that order. Pellican found him at Pforzheim in
1512 (GPR. p. 44) ; but by 31 May he had returned to Vienna (RE. 149), where
he edited a number of books for Vietor and Singren and the Alantsees. In 1514
he went to Italy, where he visited Aldus and met Gesner at Venice, and. on
2 Oct. was made Doctor of Canon Law at Bologna (MHE. ii. 303 not Vienna, as
Pelliean). In 1515 he came to Strasburg and began to work for Schiirer ;
interrupting this by a short visit to Basle in the autumn (cf. Epp. 358. 5 n. and
364 introd.) to assist in correcting the proofs of Erasmus’ Nouum lustramentum.
The remainder of his life was spent at Strasburg, where he became legal adviser
to the Bishop and the Cathedral Chapter, and 1541-3 was Public Reader in
History. He sympathized with the Reformers, and at one time was closely
connected with them ; but subsequently his literary interests reasserted them-
selves and he published many historical and geographica-l works. In March
1521 he edited the New Testament in Greek, Hagenau, T. Anshelm.

NICOLAVS GERBELLIVS ERASMO IN CHRISTO IESV SALVTEM P.

QVAM molestus mihi fuerit abitus tuus nec dicere ausim nec scribere,
videlicet 116 rursum in os mihi obiicias, linguam me velle exercere vel
eloquentiam ; in quibus quam sim egenus quamque ieiunus, ego
iamdudum expertus sum, vsque adeo manifeste vt 1166 vno etiam
teste sit opus. Vtcunque feras tamen, hoc nec volo 1166 possum dis-
simulare, nunquam mihi cum quouis homine necessitudinem fuisse
gratiorem, nullius vnquam me praesentia plus oblectatum, aut cuius-
quam penitius gauisum colloquio affatuque plusquam humano, plus-
quam suaui, plus quam dici potest iucundo, quam Erasmi mei: 661
si vel vnum aut alterum tam gratum foret in Gerbellio quam accepta
sunt mihi vniuersa in Erasmo, gaudium meum numeris absolutum
praedicarem omnibus; neque vlla re, quantumuis magna, me per·
sectius beatum esse posse quam si familiaritas nostra, qualiscunque “
sit haec, Erasmo non vndequaque displiceret.

Scio quid nunc facis, rides ; scio quid cogites, ex ore me illa loqui,

342. 1. abitus] This word suggests a residence of some length, not a mere
passing through5 cf. Ep. 337 introd.
