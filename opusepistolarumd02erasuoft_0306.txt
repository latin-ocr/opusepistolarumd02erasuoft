280 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1516

retired to Freiburg, ρο Feb. 1529. He received a lecturership in Poetry,
25 Feb. 1529, and still maintained his academy; but this period of his life
is notable rather for a number of editions of Roman histor-iaus and poets,
and also for an original work on music, Dodecachordon, 1547⁷ in which he
gives sketches of the musicians of his time. His theatrical temperament was
somewhat distastesul to Erasmus3 and their relations, though friendly, were
not always cordial. His library ultimately found its way to Munich; many
of his letters are preserved in the Staatsarchiv at Zurich. See lives by Schreiber‚
1837, and Ο. F. Fritzsche, 1890; Zw. E.; and ADB.]

ERASMVS GLAREANO SVO S. D.

MAGNOPERE optabam te hic adesse. Non potuisset deesse fortuna,
verum certa polliceri non [possum] ausim toties falsus. Princeps
adornat nauigacionem in Hyspaniam sub Idus Augusti, quanquam
incerta omnia. Vagantur et hic passim militum gregeS‚ vt nuper

5 apud vos. Si cupis euolare tuo Marte, quicquid Erasmus com-
mendacione possit, id amicissimo impendet. Monioius tuas laudes
auide accipiebat. Longum foret de singulis scribere singulis.
Proinde de ceteris ex Ludouico Bero cognosces. Illud, mi Glareane,
tibi persuasum habe, te michi ex animo charum esse, idque tuo

10 merito.

Bene vale et rescribe quam ego copiosius: nam hec scripsi ab aula
reuersus et mox aliud ingressurus iter. Discipulos tuos meo nomine
salutabis omneis. Salutabis et Oswaldum nostrum. Mitte carmen
tuum de me scriptum vna cum versibus Buschii. Rursum vale et

15 Retho medico salutem dices.

12. Discipulos] The names of
many of these occur in Glareanus’

long; as also Ursinus in his Gemm-
lz’acon (Ep. 548. 3 n.)‚ where in 1. 7

writings; especially in Book ii of his
Elegiae, Basle, Froben, 14 Nov. 1516.
Cf. also Ep. 490. 14 11.
13. oswaldum] Myconius.
carmen tuum] Λα Eo-asmum
Roteroctamum, immortale Belgarum decus,
ἑκατόστιχον, which, with the poems
mentioned in l. 14 and Ep. 463. 67,
follows this letter in all the early
editions. As the poems contain very
little of value, I have not reprinted
them. The ἑκατόστιχον is the first
poem in Glareanus’ Elegiae (l. 12 n.).
14. versibus Buschii] Hermann&
anclzz‘i Pasiphilz' in Erasmum Coloniam
recens inyressuvm probably composed
in honour of a visit from Erasmus on
his return from Basle in 1516 (cf.
Ep. 410 introd.). If it had been pre-
pared for his outward Journey in 1515,
it would presumably have been brought
to his notice earlier. It is noticeable
that Busch makes the E in Erasmus

from the end CF read Erasmo for Illi
‘nunc (HN), though elsewhere in the
poem the E is always short. Cf. also
the verse quoted in Ep. 182 introd.

15. Retho] Jerome Artolbius or
Artolphus (c. 1490—c. Aug. 1541) of
Chur3 who since c. 1515 had been
studying medicine at Basle, and who
is described in Glareanus’ Eleyiae,
14 Nov. 1516. as ‘medicus et musicus '-
In 1520 he had a school at Basle of
twenty pupils who lived with him
(cf. BRE. 157). In 1528 he was at
Besanqon (EE. 883, perhaps practising
as a physician. By 1538 he had re-
turned to Basle‚ and was Rector of
the University May—Oct.; the first
student matriculated by him being
his own son, of the same name. He
died in an epidemic of the plague
(Basler ΟΙιφ-οηίλέη, i. 162). See also
Zw. E. 1519. 363 VE. 226 and s3. 773
BRE. 135 and 143.
