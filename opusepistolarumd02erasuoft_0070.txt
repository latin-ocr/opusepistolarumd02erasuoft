et Italos longissimo interuallo praecedens, sis cum antiquitate atque
vetustis litteratorum nominibus comparandus connumerandusque.
Proinde 1100 vnum te rogo, vt ita palam te Germanum declares tuis
scriptis, ne vllo modo aut Angli aut Galli, gens in suam laudem satis
15 effusa, possint de te superbire aut suum te ciuem immodice gloriari.
Vale, vir doctissime, atque patere me aequo animo incultis te litteris
obtundere, cum ex summa in te obseruantia et admiratione proueniant.
Iterum vale.

3522 ΒΕΑ, 359 To WILLIBALD PIRCKHEDOER.

British Museum MS. Arundel 175 f. 17 (a). Basle.
P. p. 267 : O'2. p. 152: Lond. xxx. 21: LB.App.48. 24 January (1515).

[The earliest source for this letter is a manuscript volume in the Eritish
Museum which contains some miscellaneous writings by Pii-ckheimer. Some
of these are autographs, including the De Bello Elzcetico and the autobiography
edited by Riick (p. 40); others are written by a late sixteenth—century hand,
including a copy of the De Bello Eluetz‘co, four letters of Erasmus to Pirckheimer
(this 3 Ep. 362 ; Lond. xxx. 41, LB. 740 ; and one unprinted) and two draft title-
pages. From a comparison of these with the title-page of P it seems probable that
their owner, John Imhof, a great-grandson of Pirckheimer, intended to include
these papers in that edition of his ancestor’s works, and that they were in fact

it gives for the three published in P is certainly the better.

The contents of the volume, which is described in detail by Riick, clearly
formed at one time part of the Pii-ckheimer papers, most of which are now in
the Town Library at Nuremberg. In 1636 some of the papers were sold to
Thomas, Earl of Arundel, from whom they passed, by channels described in the
British Museum catalogue, into that institution.

This letter, which is in effect an answer to Ep. 318, must be dated 1515, because
the Aclaqz'a (Ep. 269) are still in progr-ess. On 24 Jan. (1515) Lister, who was
assisting at the printing, wrote to Boniface Amerbach expressing 3 hope that
they would be finished by 2 Feb. (Basle MS. G. ΙΙ. 20. f. 220>.]
