[Probably contemporary with Ep. 328, because of Seneca.

William Nesen (1493—5‚ 6 July 1524), of Nastatten (Anaxopolis) between
Coblenz and Mainz, was of peasant origin. He matriculated at Basle in 1511,
M.A. 1515 ; and was not long in making his way among the printers. In 1512-
13 Beatus Rhenanus dedicated to him Platus’ De carcere (BRE. 28). In July
1514 Nesen edited Mich. Lochmayers' Parochiale Garamum, Basle, M. Furter. In
1515 he was employed by Froben as corrector for Erasmus' Seneca (Ep. 325) ;
but his work did not give satisfaction. He was still with Froben in 1516 (Ep.
469), when he received from Erasmus the dedication of a new edition of the
Copia (Ep. 462) ; but, for a time during this period he kept a school (BRE. 135).
Early in 1517 he went to Paris as tutor to the sons of Nicholas Stalberger of
Frankf0rt; and remained with them till 1519, when Erasmus persuaded him to
come to Louvain. His lectures on Mela being prohibited by the University, on
the ground that he was not a member of it (Neve, p. 135 ; cf. Ep. 433 introd.),
he accepted an invitation to become head of the new Latin school at Franksort,
and presided over it 1520—3. He then visited Luther at Wittenberg, and joined
the Reformers; and his relations with Erasmus became less cordial in conse-
quence. He was drowned in the Elbe at Wittenberg whilst boating for

leasure.

DOMINO ERASMO ROTE. NESENVS S.

SALVE, doctissime Erasme. In operibus Senecae que tuo labore
maximo politiorum litterarum candidatis restituisti, offendimus in
margine quaedam tua manu veluti adultera et supposititia notata, his
quidem verbis, ‘Haec a quodam nebulone addita ' ; rescribe, quamuis
ego indoctior quam vt a doctissimo litteras expectare debeam, an sint 5
haec expungenda vel cum ceteris imprimenda.

Vale, Erasme doctissime, et inter tuos etiam (me) ministros
connumerato.

Raptim apud nauem, Basileae.
