386 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 5 1 6

Adrian of Baarland, not far from Borsselen in Zeeland (28 Sept. 1486
or 7-30 Nov. 1538), was one of the most active of the men of letters at
Louvain at this period. His first education was at Baarland ‘ sub modera—
toribus '. After four years at Ghent (1. 1 n.)—during which he was present
at the christening of Prince Oharles, 7 Mar. 1500-118 went to Louvain, where he
spent four years in the uncongenial study of philosophy. On proceeding MA. 0.
1507 118 devoted himself to Latinity, and e. 1509 began to support himself by teach—
ing ; being admitted in 1512 to the College du Porc. He published numerous books
for the encouragement of Latin studies and the benefit of his pupils; among
whom was William of Croy. On the foundation of Busleiden’s College he was
appointed Professor of Latin there, and delivered his first lecture on 1 Sept.
1518; but within a year he resigned and returned to private teaching, receiving
the charge c. 1523 of the youthful Charles of Croy, Abbot of Affiighem. On
4 March 1525 118 succeeded Paludanus (Ep. 180) as Professor of Rhetoric at
Louvain, an office which he held till his death.

His letter to John Becar os Borsselen (cf. Ep. 291 introd.) dated 5 Jan. (1520),
is a brief autobiography. See also Bibliotheca Belqica, 2nd series, where there is
a full bibliography and a very careful account of 1118 life, correcting 111 many
particulars and amplifying the notiees in BN and Neve, Renaissance en Belqiqwe,
pp. 194-7. In opposition to the latter’s statement that Barland was married,
the Bibl. Belgica shows that in 1516 he was in priest’s orders ; and in the preface
(1513) to the second edition of Aesop (1. 1 11.) 118 describes himself as ‘ sacris iam
initiatus’. Cornelius, his brother, is known only from this source]

HADRIANVS BARLANDVS CORNELIO FRATRI SVO SA.

L1rERAs meas, quas ad literatissimum virum Petrum Schotum
Gandaui olim praeceptorem meum tuumque exaraueram, scribis
te per tabellarium publicum transmisisse, quandoquidem ipse, ita
vt petieram, ferre non potueris: dehortante id ac prope etiam
vetante matre, quae tui amantior te noluerit longius alioqui et
periculosum propter nauigationem iter arripere. Id quod ego quoque
iam non' doleo ita euenisse ; nam vix vlla vrbs est, in qua tuto
subsidere hiis quatuor aut quinque mensibus potueris, quod morbus
pestifer aestate superiore et hoc etiam autumno quibusdam in locis
valde seuierit, in multis etiam pullulauerit tantum, idque ita occulte
ac dissimulanter vt nonnulli, in tuto atque in vado salutis quod aiunt
rem omnem esse putantes, in discrimen inciderint ignari. Quod
tantum molestiae in animo tibi esse 1100 tempore scribis vt nequeas
ad me quo soles studio ac diligentia de omni tuo atque amicorum
statu literas dare, nescio quid id sibi velit neque vnde ista tibi
molestia moesticiaque animi orta sit: quare tuum erit officium
quam primum rem omnem quae te male habet ad me transcribere,
vt te quantum possim vel consih'o vel re adiuuem.

1. Schotum] A schoolmaster at 80, whom two friends go to visit in -

Ghent, to whose care Adr. Barland another (ffic‘and ΕΒ 111 Η111811’8 edition,
was entrusted at the age of 11; see Antwerp, Apr. 1534). On publishing
Barland’s collectanea, Louvain, Th. some translations from Aesop (Ant-
Martem, March 1514, f·³. b4, repeated werp, Th. Martens, 22 Apr. 1512)
in his autobiography. In one of Barland dedicated them to Schott3
Bai-land's Dialoyi the school is 8111111181- but in the second edition (Imm-ain,
astically praised ; and Schott is perhaps Th. Martens, 21 Sept. 1513) the preface
the Ghent schoolmaster aged about to Schott is quite different.
