PETRVS AEGIDIVS ERASMO SVO S.

QvoD morbus te isthic alligat vehementer doleo. Ecquid ni
doleam, cum altera pars animae meae langueat? Audio Tunstallum
Tornaco rediisse. Cupit affinis meus, qui hasce tibi reddet, tibi
commendari, quo eum facias quam commendatissimum Tunstauo,

5 apud quem plurimum potes. Tua consuetudo, mi* Erasme, erit
gratissima. Patriam vero tibi displicere dole03 sed haec coram
copiosius. Helias et id genus homines mihi posthac haudquaquam
fucum facient. Ictus sapiam. Prostant apud nos Prognostica quae-
dam titulo Ortwini ; nihil vidi quicquam ridiculosius, si conferantur

10 cum nostratium medicorum prognosibus. Quid sit nugarum ignoro ;

tibi autem mitto quo te oblectent, si modo te capere possunt huius-
modi nugae. onrcula et parens te salutant. Bene vale.

527. FROM WILLIBALD PIRCKHEIMER.

<Nuremberg.>
<February 1517 ‘?>

Deventer MS. 91, f. 171.
LB. App. 110, 109.

[The arrangement in the manuscript, which is followed here, suggests that
Pirckheimer copied out the extract and wrote his own note below. In cor-
roboration of this view it may be noted that the copyist in the manuscript,
Hand A in both cases, has not fallen into the mistake which he committed
(with good reason; cf. an autograph by Emser, Basle MS. Gr. ΙΙ. 29) in the
heading of Ep. 553.

The date of the letter is doubtful. Dr. Reich attributes it to Jan. 1516,

3. affinis MS. : Affinius coni. Nc'clzols scite. Cf. Ep. 542.

 

1. morbus] Cf. Epp. 528. 8, 530. 4,
531· 593·

3. rediisse] Reaching Brussels on
27 Jan. ; Brewer ii. 2847.

7. Helias] 1 cannot identify.

8. Prognostica] Gemma prenostica—
tionum . . . Mayz'strz' Ortwc‘ni Gmcii, a
lampoon in the form of an almanack
for the year 1517. It is described

Ortwin Gratius (de Graes: c. 1480-—
22 May 1542) as the chief butt of Eov.
has acquired a reputation for obscu-
rantism which he did not altogether
deserve. He was born at Holtwick in
&Vestphalia³ and after education at-
Deventer under Hegius and Ostendorp
matriculated at Cologne in 1501, B.A.
1502, MA. 1506. In 1509 110 became

a corrector for the Quentell press in
Cologne, and worked there as literary
adviser for the rest of his life. His
connexion with Pfefferkorn (Ep. 487.
20 n.), whose books he translated
into Latin, drew down upon him the
unmeasured ridicule os Reuchlin’s
friend& but the bibliography given
by Reichling, containing editions by
him of Ovid, Sallust, Boethius, and
Aldus’ grammar, shows that he was
by no means out of sympathy with
humanism. In 1535 he published a
Fasciculus rerum expetendarum (see
AHVN. xxiii. 192-224)‚ which, as a
reprint of various works on the neces-
sity of Ohurch reform, was in 1564
placed upon the Index. See Bocking3
Geiger in ADB.; and alife by Reichling,
1884.
