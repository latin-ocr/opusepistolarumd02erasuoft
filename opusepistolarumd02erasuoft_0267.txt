[Rimaclus or Remaclus (1480-1524) was a native of Florennes in the
Ardennes. In the preface to his Amores, Paris, J. Badius, 15 March 1513,
he states that his father placed him in the household of John de Hoerne,
Bp. of Liege, and that 011 his patron's death, 19 Dec. 1505, he began to study
law. 'l'his was probably at Cologne‚ where he published a volume of Epicrammata,
30 Nov. 1507, and contributed verses to Ortuin Gratius’ Orationes chocllibetz'ce,
Cologne, H. de Nuscia‚ 15083 and where 110 was a friend of Cochlaeus <LB.
App. 348). Subsequently he was servant, first to Louis Vaca, tutor to Prince
Charles, then to Aloysius Marlianus (1. 8 n.) ; and finally to Aloysius Bontianus,
a member of the Council of Brabant, whom he accompanied on an embassy to
Scotland. In J an. 1512 110 was teaching in a school in London 3 see the preface
to his Palamedes, Paris, G. Gourmont, s.a., 3 prose drama dedicated with some
sacred poems to his patron Peter Griphus (Ep. 243. 60 11.). Jerome Busleiden
in a letter (p. 139 of the MS. from which Ep. 244³- is takcn; printed by Neve
in Annuaz’re de l’zmiv. cath. de Louvain, 1874, p. 407) speaks of him as deserting
a pupil and going 10 France ; perhaps for the publication of the Amores. Before
they appeared Bontianus had procured him a secretaryship in Prince Charles'
household (cf. Gachard ii. 494; the description of him in the index 10 Η as
‘a sacris' is probably incorrect); and in that capacity he was present at the
Diet of Worms in 1521 (Rivier, ΟΖ. Οὴαηεοηηείίε, p. 31). In the Acta Academiae
Louaniensis contra lutherum, ε. Ζ. et a.‚ <1520)—which Kalkoff attributes to
Erasmus—he is described as acting with Aleander and as ‘notae improbitatis
ganeo ’ ; cf. Deventer MS. 91, f. 41. See Kalkoff, Aleander 909οη Luther‚ pp. 20-3 :
and BN. i. 365, 6, where no references are given for the dates. His acquaint-
ance with Erasmus was probably formed in London. In the Spongia, LB. x.
1652 c, he is credited with an attack upon Luther.]
