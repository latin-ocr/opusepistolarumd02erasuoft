240 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 5 1 6

Not many indications are available as to Erasmus' journey. After turning
back at Kaisersberg (Ep. 412. 3) he probably touched the Rhine again at
Strasburg. He passed through Spires (Ep. 563. 31), Mainz (Ep. 413. 16),
and Cologne (Ep. 412. 7; cf. Ep. 440. 14 n.) and arrived at Antwerp on
30 May; the journev having occupied at the most seventeen days. From
Antwerp he went to Brussels and thence to St. Omer.

John Le Sauvage (1455—7 June 1518), Lord of Schaubeke, was a powerful
official, who against the wishes of Maximilian and Margaret succeeded in
accumulating many offices. He was already President of the Gouncil of
Flanders in 15063 on 24 June 1508 he was made President of the Privy
Council, and in 1509 Chaucellor of Brabant. In 1513 he was compelled to
resign the Presidency of the Privy Council, but on 17 Jan. 1515 was appointed
Chaucellor of Burgundy, and in 1516 Chaneellor of Castile. He accompanied
Charles to Spain in 1517 and died at Saragossa. For some of his many embassies
see Rymer xiii. Erasmus found him a liberal patron (cf. Ep. 4361 and dedi—
cated to him a new edition of the Institutio Principis Christiani (Ep. 393) in
1518, just after his death3 but later in life was inclined to grumble at
Le Sauvage’s treatment of him (OE. p. 201). See Leglay‚ correspondance cle
Maximilian I et (Ie Marquerite cl’Autriche; Henne; de Reiffenberg, p. 2963 and
Brewer. Sweert, Athen. Belq. p. 475, gives the inscription put up to his memory
in St. Gudule's at Brussels.]

CLARISS. D. IOANNI SYLVAGIO, REGIS CATHOLICI CANCELLARIO
SVMMO, ERASMVS ROTEROD· S. P. D.

TANDEM explicui me e laboribus Basiliensibus, vir clarissime,
fortassis serius et meis votis et amicorum expectatione, sed tamen
pro operis modo pene praepropere 3 quippe qui libello De principe
instituendo nondum absoluto discesserim, cum magnopere cuperem

5 id muneris offerre Principi ; deerat nonnihil adhuc et in Hieronymo.
Quod superest, ex tuo potissimum consilio faciam quod erit facien·
dum.

Has literas hoc consilio reliqui Antuuerpiae, vt si forte fortuna
non contigisset mihi Bruxellae aut Mechlinae tui conueniendi

10 copia, hac saltem ratione tuam celsitudinem salutarem. Nam ipse
Montioium adeo, illinc quempiam in Angliam transmissurus qui
volumina Hieronymi, quorum aeditionem inscripsi Cantuariensi, illi
reddat, simulque caeteros amicos meo nomine conueniat ac censum
anni superioris colligat. His rebus confectis mox ad vos me recipio.

15 Interea valeat incolumis tua celsitudo, vir incomparabilis et patrone
summe.

in H shows that Erasmus went not of his appointment to Tournay, where
to Tournay but to Hammes. The 116 was at this time (Brewer ii. 1995).
