was so embedded in the commentary that the two were difficult to distinguish‚
he had a copy made before sending to press. At the end five verses and a bit
are missing in the MS. 3 these Erasmus retranslated from his Latin MSS„
warning the reader of the fact in his notes (Resp. ad Adnot. Lei ii, LB. ix. 246
A—c). The ‘Codex Reuchlini’ was for long thought to be lost; but in 1861 it
was discovered in a private library at Mayhingen by Delitzsch (see his Hand·
schrzjffliche Funde, 1861-2). Erasmus describes it as so old that it might have
been written in the Apostolic age (Amwt. in Apoc. 3. 7.) ; but modern critics
attribute it to the xii0.

For his second edition (β) he had the loan of the Aureus Codex, a Latin MS. (xi0)
of the Grospels, which had belonged to Matthias corvinus, King of Hungary, and
had recently come into the hands of the Regent Margaret ; who had placed it in
the Royal Library at Mechlin. It is now in the Escurial. The Austin priory at
Corsendonk near Turnhout also supplied him with two MSS. e one (Evan. 3 : xiic)
in Greek containing the whole of the New Testament except the Revelati0n3
the other (ix-xe) in Latin containing the Gospels only. On the first leaf of each,
as well as elsewhere, he has inscribed the fact that they were used by him for
his second edition ; and from the coincidence of the dates, 19 May 1519 (f. 1 of
the Greek, wrongly copied by watstein, p. 56 ; f. 121 v⁰ of the Latin) the sugges-
tion is that these inscriptions were made when the MSS. were being returned
to Corsendonk ; the injunction ‘Seruetur’ or ‘punaxov'yrw ', which he adds, con-
veying ominous suggestion of the fate not uncommonly attending MSS. The
Greek codex is now in the Royal Library at Vienna (Suppl. gr. 52), the Latin in
the Royal Library at Berlin (Lat. theol. 4⁰. 4; Rose, 261). That Erasmus took
them with him to Basle and left them there till the printing of the second
edition was completed, is shown by his statement that Froben had one of the
illuminations from the MS. copied in Erasmus' absence, to serve as frontispiece
to a book (Apoloqia qua respondet, &c. f0. E2. v⁰ 3 J ortin ii. 515). The same Apoloyia
(1⁹⁰. A³3 J ortin ii. 497) mentions a MS. lent by Tunstall in the summer of 1517.
At Ghent, which he visited more than once in that year (cf. LB. App. 241 and
Lond. x. 24 LB. 284), the Abbot of St. Bavo showed him a Latin MS. of the
Gospels of reputed antiquity (Apol. adu. debacch. Sutoris‚ LB. ix. 766 r). Another
Greek MS. of the Gospels was borrowed from the Monastery of Mount St. Agnes
near Zwolle (Epp. 504 and 515),1)111; Ι have not been able to find any specific
mention of it in the Annotationes.

The third edition (γ) is notable for the inclusion of the heavenly witnesses in
John 1. 5. 7. To this step Erasmus was provoked by his opponents‚ Lee and
Stunica3 to whom he promised to insert the passage, if it could be shown to
exist in a single Greek MS. The required authority was discovered in England
(Armet. in loc.); and the promise was fulfilled. This MS. has been identified
with the Codex Montfortianus at Trinity College, Dublin (G. 97: xv—xvi02
Evan. 61) ; which in Erasmus’ days was probably in Franciscan hands (Rendel
Harris, op. cit. pp. 46--8). On this question he was directed also to a MS.
belonging to the Franciscans at Antwerp, where he found the words added by
a later hand in the margin; and, through Paul Bombasius‚ he consulted the
Codex Vaticanus (B), where they were wanting (Lond. xvii. 13, LB. 579). The
reference to the Vatican MS. in Armet. in Ioan. 1. 5. 7 appears in the edition of
1527 (δ), that in Act. 27. 16 not till the edition of 1535 (ε).

When at Bruges in August 1521, during the meeting of the Emperor with
Wolsey, Erasmus took the opportunity to examine the MSS. belonging to the
College of St. Donatian, of which his friend, Mark Lauweryn, was Dean. He
found there four Latin MSS. of the New Testament, some of which he describes
as dated in viii0, one containing the whole New Testament, and another being
much mutilated. Of these he availed himself in his third edition ; cf. Annoc. in
Mati. 1. 18 and 3. 16, and Ioan. 1. 5. 7.

An autograph note (Leipzig MS. Burscher collection) from Paul Tilia of
Mechlin to Peter VVychmann, Canon of Anderlecht, acknowledges the return of
a MS. which had been lent to Erasmus and on which he had recorded the variant
readings of the Aureus Codex. As Wychmann was Erasmus' host at Anderlecht
in the summer of 1521, this MS. was presumably collated for the third edition.
For this he was also able to consult the Aldine edition which had appeared in
Feb. 1518 (Apologia to 4th edit. f0. A4.' νο) ; though the number of places in which
this differed from his own is not great (Sci-ivener‚ 3rd edit. 1883, pp. 434—5).

In the fourth edition (δ : 1527) he alludes to two Latin MSS. of the Gospels‚ one
