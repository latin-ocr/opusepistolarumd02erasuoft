432] FROM JOHN FISHER 269

Neque enim dubito, si id feceris, quin erit inte liberalior quam fuerit 10
hactenus.

Ego ad Reuchlinum scripsi; nescio an acceperit meas litteras, sed
non desistam iterato scribere ; redditae enim mihi litterae eius fuere,
et prolixiores quidem, ad meam maximam voluptatem. Visus mihi
est prae caeteris quorum hactenus opera legi, ex his qui supersunt 15
palmam tenere, in rerum presertim archanarum cognitione quae vel
ad theologiam vel ad philosophiam spectant. Tu, Erasnoe, valetudi-

nem cura, et tuum ad nos matura reditum, qui gratus erit omnibus.
Vale ex Roffa.

433. FRoM ALARD or AMSTERDfflL

Deventer MS. 91, f. 104. Louvain.
LB. App. 66. 1 July 1516.

[The year-date given in the manuscript may be accepted ; for Alard’s transla-
tion (ll. 32, 3) was probably made from the Greek text of the poem as first pub-
lished in Erasmus' Lucubrationes‚ Sept. 1515, and the letter is copied by HandA:
so that only 1516 and 1517 are possible.

Alard of Amsterdam (Ἰ- 1544), a kinsman of Meynard Mann (Ep. 304. 161 n. ).
was perhaps born c. 1494; for in the preface to a Panegyric on Charles v, printed
in his Parasceu te acl sacrosanctam synaxin, CoIogne, P. Quentell, 1532, f0. ΖΕ, 110
seems to mean to describe himself as aged about 20 at the time of Charles'
inauguration at Louvain on 24 Jan. 1515. He was probably acquainted in his
youth with Wm. Herman (Ep. 33 introd. ), · for the Epistola Corn. Croci (v. infra
contains an epitaph on Herman by him. As quite a young man he taught
under Bartholomew of Cologne (Ep. 232. 67 n. ), perhaps c. 1512, at Alcmar. where
Peter Nannius was his pupil (Agric.2 p. 171 and fo· Α2 v ⁰.) By 1514 he had
settled at Louvain, where he was instrumental in securing the publication of
Agricola’ s De inuen’tioroe dialectica (Ep. 336. 1 n.). He continued there, engaged
in teaching and in literary work ; and many books of the peri-od have verses and
prefaces (cf. Ep. 78 introd.) by him. But he was not a member of the University;
for on 8 March 1519 when he was proposing to lecture on a book of Erasmus, he
was prohibited on that ground (Neve, pp. 134, 5 ; cf. Ep. 329 introd.). He became
intimate with Erasmus, who dedicated to him the letter of Eucherius to Valerian
appended to Martens' 1517 edition of Cato (Ep. 298); ef. also the Apoloyia qua
respondet iuuet-riuis Lei, f0. 0³ v⁰‚ J ortin ii. 507.

Ηο had long cherished the desire to publish a collected edition of Agricola’s
works3 and the preface, dated 31 Dec. 1522}5y to his Passio . . . Iesu Christi,
Amsterdam, Dodo Petrus, 2 April 1523, shows him at work upon masses of papers
lent to him by Pompeius Occo (Ep. 485. 3ο n.). In 1528 110 was negotiating
with publishers ; but the edition was not achieved until 1539, after tedious
sojourns at Cologne (Α3110.2 tom. pr„ p. 458). He was opposed to the Reformation ;
and in his later years published many devotional books directed against heresy.

There are two contemporary woodcuts of him ; 0110, dated 1532, in Epistola Cor-
nelii Croci, Cologne, Melchior Nouesiensis, Dec. 1531, fo· (3⁸. νο, reprinted in the
Parasceue, 1⁸⁰. Ee⁸ v⁰ ς the other, dated 1538, in Alard’s edition of Erasmus’ Carmen
bucolicum, Leiden, P. Balen, 13 Feb. 1538, 1⁸⁰. H⁴. John Murmell’s edition of
Persius, Cologne, Quentell, Sept. 1517, is dedicated to Alard. See J. Ι. Fontanus.
