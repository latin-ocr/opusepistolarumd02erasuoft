14 Cal. Septemb. 1515. Pariss.
33⁷:347. FROM MARTIN DoRP.
Schlettstadt MS. Cat. Rhen. 174 (a). Louvain.

27 August 1515.

[This letter is bound up with a number of other manuscript leaves at the end
of a copy of E and the Institutio Christiani Matrimonii, Basle, Froben, 1526, which
together form No. 174 in the catalogue of Beatus Rhenanus' books in the Town
Library at Schlettstadt. At the end of this letter are the words ‘Exscript
Basileae 1518 ’‚ written by the same hand. 1 have not been able to identify the
copyist ; who wrote also the Basle MS. A. IX. 69, Oratio pro salute Iulii secundi,
conscripta ab Heremita quodam H ybernio, angelo, vt aiunt, dictante.

In a letter to Lee (ΕΒΑ, p. 67) dated 20 May 1519 More states that Erasmus
answered Dorp hastily, but in a cooler mood suppressed his letter; and that he
himself likewise suppressed a long reply which he had composed. Erasmus'
letter has perished, but More’s has survived (LB. App. 513), probably in the
original (βὶ 3 cf. Ep. 388. 157 n.). Another manuscript of it (13²) in the unknown
hand follows this letter in the Schlettstadt volume3 but it was not printed
until after his death, in the collected edition of his Lucubratioms, Basle, 1563,
p. 365 (β3). In composing it More seems to have had before him copies of Epp.
304,337 (in its short f0rm3 cf. ll. 8, 275 nn.) and this letter ; and from it several
passages in this letter can be restored. Iu a few cases More cites the same
passage twice, at different parts of his letter. As the second text sometimes
varies from the first, both in the manuscripts and the printed volume, Ι have
designated it by 7. It will be noticed that none of Dorp's quotations from Ep.
337 agrees verbally with that letter as printed. It follows, therefore, that he
was replying to the shorter form which he actually received.

There is a reference to this letter in Ep. 545.]

ACCEPms litteris tuis incredibili affectus sum voluptate, Erasme

Ceterum vt deinceps libere tecum agam (quod ais te nunquam egre

tiam rationibus, id quod non miror, cum pollicearis ex Basilea
