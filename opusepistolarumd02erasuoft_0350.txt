LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1516

Canuntur in

templis cotidie iuxta veterem aeditionem Psalmi: et tamen extat

90 diui Hieronymi recognitio ; extat eiusdem iuxta veritatem Haebrai-

cam interpretatio. Illa leguntur in choris, haec in scholis aut domi.

Neutra alteris officiunt.

Atque adeo nuper Felix Pratensis Psalterii

totius nouam aedidit interpretationem ab omnibus superioribus ad-

modum dissidentem.

Quis huic vnquam mouit tragoedias? Iaco-
95 bus Faber Stapulensis, amicus noster, dudum id fecit in Paulum quod

ego in totum Nouum Instrumentum. Cur hic demum tanquam ad
rem nouam commouentur quidam ‘? An aliis omnibus istud licere
volunt, mihi vni non volunt? Atqui Stapulensis non paulo plus

ausus est quam ego.

Ille suam interpretationem veteri opposuit,
100 idque in academiarum omnium regina Lutetia; ego recognitorem
modo professus locos aliquot aut corrigo aut explico.

Nec hoc dixe-

rim quo Fabrum in communem inuidiam vocem—nam vir ille iam-
pridem gloria superauit inuidiam 3 sed vt palam faciam quam inique
faciant quidam, qui quod iam diu est a multis factitatum citra calu-

105 mniam, in me veluti subitum ac nouum calumniantur. Quid decessit

Malleolus3 a verse translation of the
seven penitential Psalms (Paris, A.
Denidel, aa.) 3 arguments contributed
tothe Canoxiical Epistles, Paris, Badius,
28 Nov. 1503; a versification of the
Epistle to the Romans, Badius, 5 Jan.
1507, which contains also a speech on
behalf of the clergy of Flanders,
delivered at Bruges in 1501 in resist-
ance to a proposed levy for the ex-
penses of Philip’s journey to Spain,
and a decision on a theological
question disputed by secular clergy
against the Franciscans at Ghent,
22 May 1506 ; and cf. also Ep. 95. 21 n.
On 31 May 1519 110 was staying in the
College du Lis at Louvain, whence he
dated the preface to his Conclusiones
in Sententias (Petri Lomharffi), Mar-
tens, June 1519. Faber Stapulensis
dedicated to him an edition of the
Theoloyia of John of Damascus, Paris,
H. Stephanus, 15 Apr. 1507, the pre-
face to which, dated 13 Feb. 1503, speaks
of his having recently returned to
Paris, apparently after a considerable
absence : and some letters from him
appear in the Epistola of his friend
Charles Fernand of Bruges, Paris, ε. a.
Some letters to Erasmus, encouraging
him in his work on the New Testa-
ment, were still extant in 1525 (Apol.

adu. debacch. Satoris, LB. ix. 753 r);
but Erasmus never thought fit to pub-
lish them. The date of his death is
given from some xviii⁰ collections for
the history of the Sorbonne (Paris MS.
Arsenal 1021, p. 433), in which his
epitaph in the old chapel is quoted.

92. Felix Pratensis] An Augus-
tinian friar, who being at Rome in
1515 obtained permission from Leo x
to make a new translation of the Bible
into Latin. The first specimen of this,
the Psalter, was printed at Venice,
D. Bomberg, 5 Sept. 1515, and con-
tains a papal privilege dated 10 Oct.
1515. He also edited for Bomberg a
Biblia Rabbinica, 27 Nov. 1518, which
has a preface by him to Leo dated
1517.

95. Faber] Cf. Ep. 304. 89 n.

106. Argyropylus] John A. (e. 1404-
1474), 3 Byzantine who was teaching
in Padua in 1441. From 1456-71 he
taught at Florence under the patronage
of Cosimo dei Medici 3 and afterwards
went to Rome, where Politian and
Reuchlin were among his pupils. See
Hody, Voigt and Legrand, where the
various translations from Aristotle
here referred to are enumerated.

Aretinus] Leonard Bruni (1369—
9 March 1443) of Arezzo, one of the
