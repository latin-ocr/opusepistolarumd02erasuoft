40342„ 441 FROM WILLIAM Ennii.

Epistole ad Erasmum f0. 1⁸². v0. Paris.

0¹. f0. b: ΟΞ. p. 19: F. Ρ. 6: HN: Lond. i. 6: LB. ²50· 1 May (1516).
Deventer MS. 91, f. 192 (α).

Budaei Epistolae (1531) f. 117 v⁰ (β).

[This letter was printed by Erasmus in Β within a few months of its arrival;
and then with three others—its two answers and Ep. 388-shortly afterwards in
0¹ ‚ in this case from a desire (Ep. 531. 533 ⁷6) to rectify the blunder in l. 149 on
which Budaeus remarks in Ep. 493. 45 seq. It is also found in the Deventer Letter-
book and in BE³. ; having in the former the notable feature that the Greek is
all translated into Latin, except the special words the precise meaning of which
is here discussed. As the printed versions issued by Erasmus and Budaeus
agree in having the Greek, there can be no doubt that this was in the original.
It may be conjectured, therefore, that the Latin versions were made by Erasmus
—perhaps dictated offhand3 for the variants given in the translation of l. 132
suggest a tentative rendering—on behalf of a servant-pupil (Hand A), to relieve
him from much copying of an unfamiliar language.

In BE.³ the Greek is on the whole more correctly printed than in B and its
followers. But its occasional amplifications indicate that Budaeus polished up
the letter before printing it; for these cannot have been part of the original,
since they are missing in both B and the Deventer manuscript, which are
independent copies of it. Ι therefore give the precedence to B as closer to the
original than either α or β : which for convenience Ι have placed at the end of
the sigla, i.e. after LB.

The year-date is given by the arrival of the Nouum lustramentum in Paris
(l. 28 n.). Writing on 6 June 1516 Badius mentions the dispatch of this letter
through Arnold Birckmann (MHE. ii. 37) ; it reached Erasmus from Cologne on
1 June E .421, 23).

9Wm. linge (26 Jan. 146}-23 Aug. 1540) sprang from a family of state officials.
In 1484 he entered the College of Navarre at Paris as a student of theology
(Launoi‚ Nauarr. qymn. hist. p. 217), but subsequently went to Orleans to study
law 3 and this he abandoned in its turn for literature c. 1491. He learnt Greek
first from Hermonymus (1. p. 7. 22 n.) and then from John Lascaris (Ep. 269.
51 n.); and Faustus in addressing to him his De influentia syderum in 1496 (Ep. 84
introd.) describes him as ‘ Graeca et Latina litteratura insignitum ’. In 1497 he
became one of the royal seeretaries, and served on embassies to Italy in 1501
and 15053 but his literary activities were not thereby checked. His first ven-
tures were translations from Plutarch and Basil ; the earliest dated 1503, though
no printed edition is known earlier than 1505 (cf. Ep. 421. 25 n.). More
important are his Annotationes in :xxiv Pandectarum libros, Paris, Badius, 17 Nov.
1508,--a work in which he showed marked originality‚ by discarding the vast
accumulation of glosses and by attempting to restore the purity of the text
through study of manuscripts‚-and the De Asse, Paris, Badius, 15 March 151ἓ,
which isan attempt to define the relative money values of classical and Renaissance
times and thereby to determine the conditions of ancient civilization. In 1519‘
he was summoned to court by Francis 1, for whom he had written the Institution
du Prince (see Woodward, Studies in Education‚ chap. 7) ; and he made use of his
position to further the cause of good learning in France, notably by persuading
Francis to make the College de France trilingual. His own continued enthusiasm
for Greek is shown by his Commentarii linquae Graecae, Paris. Badius, Sept. 1529,
by a collection of Greek letters published in ΒΕ3, and by a treatise De transitu
Hellenismi ad Christianismum, Paris, R. Stephanus, 5 March 1535, in which he
defends his favourite studies from a charge of alliance with heresy.
