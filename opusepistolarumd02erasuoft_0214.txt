386. FROM URBAN RIEGER To JOHN FABER.

Epistole ad Erasmum ff. h² and h3 v0. Ingolstadt.
Ο2 pp. 266, 270: F. pp. 97, 98: HN: Lond. ii. 17, (c. February 1516.)
18: LB. 229, 230.

[This letter, to which Ep. 392 is practically the answer, is printed in all the
later editions as two; the postscript which follows the signature appearing as
a separate letter with a heading of its own. It is, however, clearly, as suggested
by Horawstz, ιῙοΙι. Heiqerlin, yenannt Faber, p. 17, n. 1, a postscript, written by
Rieger in his own name on a blank space at the end, and is printed thus without
heading in B and (3². In Ep. 412. 21, too, the ‘vna epistoia’ sent for More to
see is evidently this, · for the invitation to Ingolstadt is mentioned in the corre-
sponding place in Ep. 413. The divisionis due to an error In 0² the postscript
happens to come at the top of the last page. In the previous opening the head—
line—minvs REGIVS 10Am<1 ranno-is spread across the two pages; but on
the last itis necessarily contracted into one. The editors of F mistook it for the
heading of a new letter, and made the separation.

Urban Rieger (Regius or Rhegius) of Langenargen on the N. shore of the Lake
of Constance (May 1489—225 May 1541) was perhaps the son of a priest. After
education at Lindau he went to Freiburg, where he lived with Zasius and took
his B.A. About 1510 he migrated with John Eck to Ingolstadt, and after
taking his. M.A. opened a house for pupils, but fell into financial difficulties.
From these he was delivered by Eck, who got him a lecturership in Rhetoric and
Poetry ; and in 1517 he was crowned Poet laureate by Maximilian. After this
he resumed the study of theology and settled at Constance, where on 16 Sept.
1518 in John Faber's house he completed his De diqm'tate sacerdotum, Augsburg‚
Miller, 19 Feb. 1519, addressed to Hugo von Landenberg, Bp. of Constance (BRE.
101), and in 1519 was ordained. He visited Tiibingen (matric. 20 Aug. 1519)
and Basle (matric. 28 Sept. 1520); and then through Faber’s influence was
appointed Cathedral preacher at Augsburg. He began to incline towards
Lutheran opinions, and in Dec. 1521 was obliged to leave Augsburg. Fora time
he was preacher at Hall, near Innsbruck; but in 1523 was in trouble with
the BPS. of Trent and Brixen, and returned to Augsburg, where the Reformation
was now established. In Dec. 1524 he definitely adopted Lutheranism, and on
16 June 1525 married. He played a mediating part in the religious struggles at
Augsburg‚ but in 1530 was finally obliged to depart, through the action of

settled at Byzantium. After the praised but

capture by the Turks he was brought
to Italy, where he received patronage
from Lorenzo dei Medici and, though
a soldier, became an excellent Latinist
and writer of verse. His Epiyrammata
were printed at Rome in 1490 and
1493; and again in 1497 at Florence,
with his Hymni Naturales addressed to
the gods of Greece and Rome. This
v olume had been reprinted by Schurer
in July 1509 with two prefaces by
Beatus Rhenanus, one addiessed to
Sapidus; in which the poetry is

its pagan character
deplored (BRE. 12 and 432). Erasmus’
judgeinent of it in the Ciceronianus
(LB. i. roma) is to the same effect3

but Muretus and Scaliger rate it more ⁴

highly. It certainly does not merit the
epithet ‘lasciuus'. He was drowned
with his horse in a quicksand of the
Cecina. See Hody, De Graecis illustribus,
1742, pp. 276—93; Munro’s introd. to
Lucretius, where the value of his work
on Lucretius is recognized 3 and NBG.

7. Scripseram] Probably in answer
to Ep. 368.
