502] FROM THOMAS MORE 419

'character in which is ‘Iulii Genius '. From this direct statement of the exist-
ence of a copy written by Erasmus’ own hand, there can be no doubt that he was
the author of it; although by many equivocal utterances-—none of which is
a direct denial—he attempted to conceal the fact. Besides this draft- another
can be traced somewhat earlier at Basle, where it was copied by Bruno and
Boniface Amerbach (Basle MS. A. IX. 64). Bruno's work is unfinished, but
Boniface brought his to a successful end and added the colophon: ‘ Basileiae
foeliciter in edib. tuis excriptum Non. Augusti Anno mnxw. θεσμὸν ἔρως οὐκ οἶδε
βιημάχος. Bo. Am01·bacch.’ At the time Boniface was evidently at home for
a holiday from his legal studies under Zasius. Six days later he completed his
famous copy of Velleius Patereulus (p. 114), to which he appended an almost
identical colophon; and other MSS. by him perhaps written at this period are
Glareanus’ Heluetia (Basle MS. O. 11. 14), which is partly in his hand, and the
copies of Epp. 338,9, the duplicates os which had, however, been already returned
by Froben in June (Ep. 419). On the back of the Velleius, and written hastily
by Boniface in his later years and by his son Basil, is a list in which the Iulius
and the Heluetia are enumerated (see Robinson Ellis' Velleius Paterculus, Oxford,
1898, pp. xiii, xiv) ; a fact which suggests that these MSS. may have formed
a group which was kept together for some years, and therefore had perhaps
some unity in date of origin. The word tuis, which occurs in the colophons
of both the Iulius and the Velleius (not suis as Orelli and Ellis), offers a clue
to show in whose hands the Iulius then was 3 but I have not been able to follow
it up. As author of the Heluetia Glareanus is possible3 but the temporary
possession of the Murbach MS. of Velleius and of Erasmus' Briefs from Rome
points with more probability to Froben or Beatus Rhenanus. In any case it is
quite clear that the Iulius must have been known to Erasmus' intimate friends
at Basle as early as August 1516.

From another source, too, there is evidence of a copy in Erasmus' autograph—
in the letter to Bucer dated 2 March 1532 (p. 407), where Erasmus, in defending
himself against a charge of having published some of his works anonymously
(cf. Jortin, i. 406 n.)‚ says: ‘Sed de Iulio potes et testibus docere vnde primum
prodierit. Non statim is autor est qui sua manu descripsit, etsi tu testes
producas istius suspitionis autores. Eadem opera inures perfidiae notam iis
quos tu cupis habere fidissimos. Si cum Neseno nunquam habuissem familiari·
tatem, multis molestiis caruissem in quas ille me coniecit.' Bucer, it is clear,
had adduced the testimony of Nesen (Ep. 329) that he had seen the Iulius in
Erasmus’ handwriting, probably at Basle; for though Nesen may have met
Lupset inParis in 1517, the draft in Lupset’s possession presumably returned
now to Erasmus.

Neither Erasmus’ attempt to rebut Bucer’s charge nor his deliverances on tho
subject in LB. App. 160 and 1683 Lond. x. 19, LB. App. 173 Jortin ii. 397,
LB. 583 amount to a denial. Even his elaborate repudiations to Campegio
(Lond. xii. 1, LB. 416) and WVolsey (Lond. xi. 1, LB. 317) do not exceed his
powers of equivocaffion, and, as J ortin points out (ii. 596 n.), the only thing that
he there specifically denies is the publication; as to which he is doubtless
strictly correct, considering the custom of the time ε cf. vol. i, pp. 121, 594, and
also the publication of the Utopia (p. 339).

According to his calculation in LB. 416 the Iulius was composed c. 1513-14;
perhaps at Cambridge, since it passed into Lupset's hands (Ep. 431; cf.
Ep. 270. 60 n.). It was not widely known until its appearance in print, at
the beginning of 1517 (cf. Epp. 532. 23 and 543. 9). Another issue, at
Cologne, in the summer of 1518, is mentioned by Nesen, Gilles, and Dorp
(Basle MS. G. ΙΙ. 30. 833 Lond. vii. 28 and 1, LB. 436 and 323). The first
editions were undated3 the earliest with a date which occurs in Bocking's list
(Huttem' opera, iv, pp. 422 seq.) being by Martens at Louvain, Sept. 1518. The
MS. copies by J. A. Brassicanus, 24 Aug. 1517 (Vienna MS. 9846 ff. 16-59), and
by the writer in the Munich MS. (p. 35), 31 Dec. 1518, were both probably
made from printed books.

The secret of the authorship must have been known to many of Erasmus*
friends3 and thus though Morillon’s suggestion in Ep. 532 may have been
a mere guess‚ Beatus Rhenanus' ignorance in 1519 (BRE. 426) must be feigned;
and again LB. App. 265 and Lond. x. 19, LB. App. 17 (1519), though addressed
to More, must have been meant to reach other ears. More also, when in 1520
he took up arms in Erasmus· behalf (Eev. p. 118), makes no real denial ; and in
