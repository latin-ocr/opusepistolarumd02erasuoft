325. To THOMAs RUTHALL.

Senecae Lucubrationes f0. a² (a). Basle.
Gouda MS. 1324, f. 23 v0 (β). 7 March 1515.

[The preface to the edition of Seneca's Lucubrationes‚ for which Erasmus had
prepared in England and which he left to be printed by Froben after his
departure from Basle. The book was begun in April (Ep. 328. 17 n.) and
finished in August 1515. In 1. p. 13. 14-24 Erasmus enlarged upon the careless-
ness of the friends whom he had left in charge of the work and on the fraudu-
lence of one in particular, who removed part of the manuscript. Beatus
Rhenanus (Epp. 328 and 330) plainly was one of those censured by Erasmus,
who does not mince his words even about his friends ; and possibly the
Amorbachs also helped with the edition. But it is clear from a comparison of
Erasmus' various {utterances on the subject that the chief offender was
william Nesen (cf. Epp. 328, 329, 3303 and Lond. xxi. 4, xix. 3, xxi. 26; LB.
689, 714 and 782). In an emended edition of Seneca published in March 1529,
Basle,.H. Froben and J. Herwagen, with a new preface, Lond. xxviii. 12, LB.
1010, Erasmus speaks of him with more moderatiori. F-rom the same preface it
appears that the Lucubratioraes did not reach Ruthall until Erasmus' return to
England in 1516 (cf. Ep. 437) 3 and that Ruthall was in consequence annoyed.

There is a copy of this letter in one of the Gouda manuscripts (App. 9) ; but
as there are no variants except such as might be made by a elever but not over-
careful writer, copying from the printed book, Ι have not given it precedence.

For Erasmus' work at the tragedies of Seneca also see 1. p. 13, and Ep. 2634
