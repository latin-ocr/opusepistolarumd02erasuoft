te in Britaniam proficiscentem venturum intellexeram. Verum-
tamen hac neglecta occasione aliam repperi viam per quam etiam
Occeanum te nauigantem litteris meis consectarer. Nam R(obertum>
W<imphildum>, qui oratoris munere apud Caesaream maiestatem
Anglorum regis (nomine) fungitur, virum clarissimum ac doctis-
simum mihique amicum, rogaui vt has ad te mitteret litteras3 qui,
vt spero, id quod opto efficiet. Bene igitur et tu feceris, mi Erasme,
si amiciciam nostram inchoatam litteris celebrare perges ; qua re nil
iucundius mihi facere poteris.

327. To BEATUS RHENANUS.

[The preface to Enarratio alleqortca in primum Psalmum, printed in Erasmus’
Lucubrationes, Strasburg, Schiirer, Sept. 1515 (α). Τ116 Enarratio was printed
separately by Martens at Louvain, Oct. 1515, without change in the preface.
There isa slight alteration in Schiirer’s edition of the Lucubrationes, June 1516 (β),
which is followed by his of Nov. 1517 and Jan. 1519 and by Froben's of July 1518
and Oct. 1519. There are also signs of revision in Froben's edition of Exactissimcw
enarrationes in aliquot Psalmos (γ), s.a. (1524 ⁶3), reprinted in Feb. 1525. Ι have not
been able to examine γ, but have taken a volume with the same title published
by Cervicornus at Cologne in 1524 as areprint of it ; in view, however, of certain
publications of Cervicornus in 1524 it is possible that his edition of the Enarra-
tz'ones has the priority over Froben'S.

Mr. Nichols, guided by the dates assigned to the printed versions of Epp. 333,4,
alters the place from St. Omer to London 3 but the manuscript date of Ep. 333
removes the necessity of finding Erasmus in London at this time.

Beat Bild (22 Aug. 1485—20 May 1547) was the third son of Antony Bild,
a butcher of Schlettstadt, whose family originated from the neighbouring village
of Rheinau. The young Beatus was educated first at Schlettstadt, under
Hofman and Grebwiler (p. 8). Leaving his father's house on 25 Apr. 1503
116 arrived in Paris on 9 May, and matriculated in the University, taking his
Β.Α. 111 1504, and M.A. 1505. For two years he worked as a corrector in the
press of Henry Stephanus ; but in the autumn of 1507 returned to Schlettstadt,
where he remained for about a year. During that time he began to write
prefaces for books published by Schiirer, who in June 1508 had opened his press
at Strasburg; and in the winter of 1508-9 he moved to Strasburg, in order to
take more active part in Schiirer's undertakings. On 31 J uly 1511 he arrived in
Basle, attracted by the fame of Kuno of Nuremberg (p. 41) ; and there he
remained for 15 years, living with Amorbach and Froben and devoting himself
entirely to the service of good learning in editing and superintending new books.
In 1526 he returned to Sohlettstadt, which became his home for the remainder
of his life. His literary output was very great. In BRE. 68 volumes are
cnumerated in which he avowedly had a share, including the editio princeps of
Velleius Paterculus (Basle, Froben, November 1520), from the MS. found by him
in 1515 in the abbey of Murbach, near Gebweiler in Alsace. To Erasmus he was
devotedly attached, and he was content to efface himself and conceal his own
labours in supervising the publication of his friend's innumerable writings. His
library, which is exceedingly rich in books of the period, is preserved almost
intact in the Town Library at Schlettstadt.
