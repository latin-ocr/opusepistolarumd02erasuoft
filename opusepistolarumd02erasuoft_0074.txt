LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1515

sciscitareris ab eo per literas, si forte illum non conueneris, vnde
acceperit genealogiam illam sacrosanctae virginis Mariae quam

Vehementer enim scire cupio

vnde habeat ea res authoritatem, simulque quonam modo fieri possit
vt, cum iuxta Philonis breuiarium Solomonis linea penitus intercisa
fuerit, ipsa nihilominus ex Solomone illic descendisse tradatur.
Coneris, Erasme, vt meus Reuchlin dignetur me de his duobus

Reuchlin commendatissimum facias ; quem haud dubie viserem ipse,

si non his sacris vestibus essem indutus.’

Haec, mi Reuchlin, vir ille

clarissimus suapte manu ad me scripsit ; quae ad verbum ad te tran-

scripsi, vt ex his intelligas quanti te faciat.

Dignus est cui morem

Nos hoc in procinctu scripsimus, et quidem occupatissimi3 nam

Quod attinet ad editionem operum Hieronymi,

tantum abest vt vel pilum tuorum laborum aut gloriae mihi velim
vindicare, vt citius aliquid de meo in te transfuderim. Cum eum
laborem susciperem, ignorabam te in eodem versari: quanquam non
agimus idem. De Hebraicis literis nihil arrogo mihi, quas primo-

14. genealogiam] On pp. 19-31 of
Reuchlin's Rudimenta Hebraica, Psorz-
heim, Anshelm‚ 27 March 1506. It
is compounded of the two given for
Joseph in Matt. 1 and Luke 3; and
follows the latter, vv. 31—8, from
Adam to David, and 24-7, from
Shealtiel to Matthat, the former, vv.
6-12‚ from David through Solomon to
Shealtiel. The pseudo—Philo’s Breuia-
rium de Temporibus, which was printed
in Latin at Rome and Venice in 1498
and at Paris in 1510 and 1512 in
a small collection of writers on
chronology, perhaps forged by their
first editor, Annius of Viterbo, repre-
sents the seed of Solomon as being cut
off and one of the descendants of
Nathan as carrying on the line; thus
agreeing with Luke. Reuchlin's
genealogy makes Matthat the father of
Jehoiakim (whose name he states on
the authority of the same Breuz’arium
to be equivalent to the Heli who in
Luke is the father of Joseph) and
Jehoiakim the father of Mary. He
uses it merely as a convenient instru-
ment for teaching Hebrew letters and
syllables ; and states in his prefatory
remarks that his readers will have
heard it ‘saepe in ecclesia, licet
indocte pronunciatam, festis diebus ’.

This is perhaps the occasion on
which Erasmus wrote to consult

Reuchlin on behalf of an English
theologian ; see his Resp. acl Annot. Lei,
Basle, Froben, 21 July 1520, p. 73 (LB.
ix. 160 Δ). But if 50, his memory was
at fault in the details.

27. Romam] Mr. Nichols proposes to
read statim, on the ground that Erasmus
could. hardly have been contemplating
a Journey to Rome so shortly before he
actually went to England 3 but Ep. 323.
21 shows that he had fixed 1 March as
the date of his departure for Italy; for
the motive of the journey see Ep. 328.
36 n. From Ep. 322 it appears that
he was hesitating between Italy and
England.

28. tuorum laborum] Pellican (CPR.
pp. 38‚9) states that in 1508 he began
at John Amorbach’s request to revise
the Hebrew passages in Jerome3 and
that Reuchlin had already done the
same for the Greek. But in view of
RE. 109 and RE. p. 360 Pellican's date
should probably be 1509. In J uly-
Aug. 1510 Reuchlin visited Basle to

give further assistance with the >

Hebrew (MHE. i. Ι). See also iv.
260 and RE. In 1509 Conrad Leon-
torius (RE. pp. 360,1) and in 1512
Sapidus (Basle MS. G. II. 30. 178. 4)
also took some part in the work.

Erasmus had help from the Amorbachs
for the Hebrew (Aday. 2001 fin. and
