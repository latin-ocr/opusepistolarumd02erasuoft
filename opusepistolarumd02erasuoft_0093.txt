333] ΤΟ RAFFAELLE RIARIO 69

Α comparison os the letters with the greatly amplified versions publishcd in
A leaves no doubt of the genuineness of the manuscript; and the promptness
with which Erasmus had them printed on his return to Basle—the first of his
letters proper to be published by himself—raises the question, Why should he
have wished to create the impression that they were written at the beginning
of his visit to England instead of at what must have been the very end ‘? His
motive is to be looked for in connexion with those whom he desired to mislead
—clearly not with the recipients of the letters. Possibly it was that he wished
Warham and his English friends to belleve that in the earliest days of his visit
to England he was already committed to proposals for dedicating Jerome to the
Pope. The mistake of dating Epp. 333, 4 in March, when Erasmus was not
in England (Ep. 327 introd.), as his English friends must have known, may be
due to the supervisors of the printing‚ who perhaps received instructions to date
Epp. 333, 4 before Ep. 335 in accordance with actual facts, but overlooked the
necessity of altering the place.

The existence of this manuscript affords an excellent opportunity for estimating
the treatment to which an ‘elegant epistle ’ might be subjected, without any
concealment (Ep. 360. 10, 1), before publication. To avoid the insertion of long
passages in the critical notes I have adopted the text of A, except for the date.

Raff. Riario (3 May Ι46ῐ-«9 July 1521) of Savona was at this time one of the
most powerful prelates in Rome. He had been created Cardinal in 1477 through
his uncle's influence with Sixtus 1v; had been a candidate for the Papacy in
1503 ; and Leo x’s most formidable rival in the election of 1513. See Creighton
iii, iv, and Ciaconius iii. 70-6. It was at his request that Erasmus wrote the
oration against the war with Venice, when in Rome in 1509 (Ι. p. 37. 7-10);
perhaps in the course of some Iessons on oratory (cf. Ep. 340. 45 n.).]

Qvon annis iam aliquot meae siluerunt litterae, non tuorum in me
