[The year-date added in H is confirmed by the various subjects mentioned:

Meghen's dispatch to England and return (Ep. 412 introd.)‚ Erasmus’ recovery
from illness (cf. Ep. 415. 4 seq.)‚ and the intention of visiting his English friends,

which he shortly carried out.]

438. To MARTIN DORP.

Dorpii Oratio, tit. v0. Brussels.
N: Lond. xxvii. 58: LB. App. 423· 10 July (1516‘?>.

[A congratulatory letter printed at the beginning of Dorp's Oratio in praebe-
ctionem epistolarum diui Pauli, Ant-werp, M. Hsslen, 27 Sept. 1519. In a preface
(BRE. 126) dated 22 Sept. (1519) Dorp states that the oration was delivered
three years before. Erasmus’ letter was evidently written after a sight of it in
manuscript.

The only years possible are 1516-19 ; and of these the two latter are excluded,
1518 because Erasmus was at Basle in J uly, and 1519 because Tunstall was in
England. Between 1516 and 1517 it is not easy to decide. That in 1516 Erasmus
went to Brussels about 10 J uly in response to the invitation conveyed in Ep. 436
may be taken as certain ; although there is no definite mention of such a visit.
On this view we may suppose that he met there Paludanus (Ep. 180) and was
shown by him the manuscript of Dorp’s oration, which contained several flatter-

On the other hand, the discrepancy he might have had the prebend him-
between the sum offered in Ep. 443 and self, but stood asido in favour of
that actually received by Erasmus is Erasmus (EE. 141).
