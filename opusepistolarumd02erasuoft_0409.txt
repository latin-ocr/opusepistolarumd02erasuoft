Ostendit mihi Dorpius libellum Pepricorni scriptum aduersus 20
Epistolas Obscurorum Virorum, in quibus ostendit delitescere nescio
quas hereses Bohemicas. Quid tandem fiet, si in huiuscemodi nugis
reprehendendis non sint canes muti theologi sed clarissime latrent?
Μο11115 esset rem silentio contemnere quam scribendo et argu-
mentando in infinitum augere.

Haec habui quae scriberem, doctissime Erasme; quae vt boni
consulas velim. Bene vale.

[The date is unquestionable.

Louis Ber (24 May 1479-—24 Apr. 1554) was born at Basle, and in his youth
lived opposite John Amorbach, from whom he received much kindness. His
university education was obtained in Paris, where he became B.A. 1497—8,
MA. 1499. In 1500 he entered the Sorbonne‚ and became a Fellow in 1504.
He continued to study theology, living in the College of St. Barbara, and in the
examination for the Doctor’s Degree in 1512 he stood first (cf. Epp. 305. 199 and
413. 11 n.). After that success he returned to Basle and was incorporated in
the University 1512-13, entered the Theological Faculty 27 Aug. 1513, was Dean
of it 1514-15, and Rector of the University 1514 and 1520. From the Bishop,
Christopher of Utenheim, with whom he was much in sympathy, he received
the Provostship of St. Peter's Church in Basle; but in a stronger degree than
his patron he was opposed to the Reformatiom and did what he could to prevent
the printing of Lutheran books in Basle. In consequence of the triumph of
reform he withdrew in January 1529 to Freiburg, where the remainder of his
life was spent. In June 1530 (Janig p. 45) and again 111 June 1535 he visited
Rome. A treatise De praeparatione ad mortem, Basle‚ Jo. Oporinus, Nov. 1551
(and editu), seems to be his only published work. It contains also a sensible
Responsio in the form of a letter, dated from Freiburg 23 Feb. 1551, to some one
who had questioned the propriety of flying before the plague. In BRE. 18
the form Βαίρῳ occurs for his name; but in an autograph letter at Basle he
signs himself ‘Ludouicus Ber', and this form occurs also in the Responsio f0. V⁴.
The date given above for his death is from the matriculation-register at Basle

pamphlets in support of his aims.

who had been converted to Christia-

the Dominicans he set himself with
fanatical zeal to the conversion of the
Jews, and for this end proposed the
destruction of all Jewish books; a
scheme which was frustrated by the
