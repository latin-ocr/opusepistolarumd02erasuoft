68 LETTERS oF ERASMus [1515

est Cancellarius Principis illustrissimi ; Tornaci Montioius meus, qui
nunc ei praefectus est vrbi regias agens vices ; apud diuum Andoma-
rum abbas Bertinicus. Traiectio sumptuosa fuit et periculosa, sed
tamen velox. Vas meum quod fratri Francisci commiseram, nondum
aduectum est; qua re mihi nihil potuit contingere infelicius. In eo
sunt omnia in Hieronymum commentaria 3 quae nisi mature recepero,
cessabunt Basileae qui excudunt, non sine magno suo malo. Id si
casu factum est, factum est infelicissime 3 sin arte et data opera, quo
vetera sua Prouerbia prius extrudant, factum est inimicissime ε nihil
enim est in quo me magis laedere potuisset. Exhibiturus eram
Episcopis suos libros; eos nunc saluto vacuus et dimittor item ab
illis vacuus. Quod si vas misissent, sicut erant polliciti, iam nunc
istic adessem. Adsunt Brugis duo totius Angliae doctissimi,
Gutbertus Tunstallus‚ Archiepiscopi Gantuariensis cancellarius, et
Thomas Morus, cui Moriam inscripsi, vterque mihi amicissimus. Si
quid forte inciderit in quo possis illis gratum facere, rectissime
collocaris officium tuum. Admone Franciscum super hisce rebus.
Vti spero, ante Iulium vos renisam. Interim cura vt recte valeas,
amice incomparabilis. Londini Nonis Maii. [M.D. xnus}

[The date of this letter is conclusively established from its contents. It was
first published in August 1515, with a date 31 March 1515, which conflicts with
Epp. 327 and 332; and in consequence Mr. Nichols has proposed to alter the
place from which Ep. 327 is addressed, and is obliged to suppose that Ep. 332
was written six weeks after arrival, while Dr. Reich has suggested the assimila-
tion of this and Ep. 334 to Ep. 335 by the easy conversion of the date from
31 March to 3ο April, according to a not uncommon form of confusion. The diffi-
culty is, however, removed by a manuscript copy, of the concluding portion of
this letter, from 1. 83 onwards, and of the whole of Ep. 335, which exists in the
library of Basle University. The manuscript is not an autograph, but is written
in a contemporary German hand ; and Ep. 335 follows this immediately on the
same side of the first leaf, Ep. 334 and the beginning of this letter having been
probably on a previous leaf. At the end of Ep. 335 a hand, which is perhaps
Erasmus', has scrawled ‘ Nimio soloecismo non opus est ’‚ in jesting comment on
the character of the handwriting.
