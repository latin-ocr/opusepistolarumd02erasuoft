[Erasmus’ movements at this time cannot be traced closely. He was now
preparing to start for England (1. 24), and he presumably crossed shortly
afterwards. Of the friends and patrous whom he desired to see many were
away from London, Fisher in particular being at Cambridge (Ep. 432. 2 n.).
After waiting several days in London, Erasmus was on the point of following
Fisher to the University when news came of the Bishop’s return (Ep. 512. 25-8>.
The time in London had been spent in the final composition of the appeal
to Rome (cf. Ep. 447 introd.)‚ which was one of the main purposes of this visit
to England. That done and committed to Ammonius, he accompanied Fisher
to 'Rochester for ten days (cf. Ep. 456 introd.) and then set out on his return
journey3 reaching Calais about 27 Aug. Thence he hastened to Brussels
(Ep. 467. 4), doubtless to visit the Chancellor and make his Courtray prebend
secure ς and shortly afterwards to Antwerp, where he stayed for a month with
Gilles. His intention on leaving England had been to settle at Louvain (cf.
Epp. 465. 3 and 468. 14); but the auspices were not favourable, and lie pre-
ferred to spend the winter between Brussels and Antwerp.

Valerius Andreas’ statement (Fasti acad. Louan. p. 85) that he matriculated
at Louvain on 31 Aug. 1516 as ‘doctor bullatus' cannot be correct. In view
of Lond. xxx. 23, LB. 274 it is probably to be referred to the following year.]
