[There are two manuscripts of this letter and Ep. 339 in the Basle University
Library. One (13¹) is in the hand of Boniface Ammbach, and from its similar-ity
with the Velleius (Basle Ms. AN. 11. 38), which he finished copying on 11 Aug.
1516, it was probably written at the same period ; an inference which, as will be
seen, accords with the facts. The other, Urk. IIb. 3 (13²), is in the hand of
Com-ad Fonteius (p. 67), and though it agrees with β1 except in some negligible
variants, its reading in Ep. 339. 1 shows that it is independent.

The letters were first printed in B in Oct. 1516 ; but later in the year they
were published separately by Beatus Rhenanus (B3) in response to a request
from Othmar Nachtgall. The book, Breue sanctissimi domini nostri Leonis X ad
Desyderium Erasmum Roteroclamum, Basle, Froben, consists of only eight pages and
is without date; but Beatus’ preface to Nachtgall (BRE. 54) is dated ‘pridie
Calendas Ianuarias. Anno M.1>. xw', which in BRE. is interpreted as 31 Dec.
1515. According to commonet practice, however, the date should mean 31 Dec.
1516 ; and this is confirmed by the wanderings of the letters before they reached
Erasmus’ hands. On arriving in England‚ perhaps c. 19 August 1515 (Brewer
ii. 823), they were given into the charge of Ammonius. He, feeling uncertain of
Erasmus' movements, retained them; and it was not till Feb. 1516 that he
ventured to send one of the duplicatas of Ep. 338 and the copy of Ep. 339,
together with Ep. 340, through Pace (Ep. 427 and 429) to Erasmus at Basle
(Ep. 389. 20-26). After following Pace into Italy (Jortin ii. 347) these did not
reach Basle until Erasmus had left; and though they were dispatched after him
(Epp. 419 and 460), the first that he saw of these proofs of Papal favour was
when Meghen (Ep. 412 introd.) arrived at Antwerp in July 1516 with the other
copy of Ep. 338 sent by Ammonius (Ep. 429. 5, 6). Ep. 339 he cannot have
seen till he reached England a few days later (Ep. 429 and 457. 37, 8). The
documents sent through Pace, except Ep. 340, were finally delivered to him at
Antwerp in September (Ep. 475. 36, 7 ; cf. Brewer ii. 2299).

3¹ and [3⁸ agree together and differ from B in two important readings, where
Erasmus decided to alter the text. It is clear, therefore, that Boniface’s copy
was taken from the documents sent by Ammonius to Basle3 and that Beatus’
book may have been printed from his manuscript. Further confirmation for
the date assigned to Beatus' preface is given by the mention in it of his recent
visit to Strasburg ; cf. Ep. 460 and BRE. 62.

Sadolet, who composed Epp. 338 and 339, had been appointed Papal Secretary
on the accession of Leo x. The dates given are unquestionable.]
