Quod moliris in ius Caesareum illustrandum, precor vt Musae
bene fortunent; scis, opinor, Budaeum Parisiensem tale quiddam 45
esse conatum; et Outbertus Tonstallus, Cantuariensis Archiepiscopi
cancellarius, vir vtriusque literaturae callentissimus, innumeros habet
locos annotatos. Quod in tuis commentariis nostri mentionem facis
meque paras immortalem reddere, magnopere gratum est laudari
a viro omnium laudatissimo. Vnum illud a te rogo, ne posthac tam 50
inuidiosis titulis oneres Erasmum, ne quam nasutulis irridendi mei
praebeas ansam. Quis enim non rideat Erasmum magnum appellari,
qui nulla non parte minimus sit? ad haec felicem, cui nihil est quod
fortunae possit acceptum ferre ⁶? Bonifacium, iuuenem iuxta modestum
atque eruditum, quaeso ne graueris meo nomine salutare. Resalutat 55
te Gerardus Listrius noster ex animo, vt tui studiosissimus, ita
dignus profecto quem tu mutuo, sicut facis, diligas. Bene vale.

[An original letter, in Erasmus* autograph throughout, except for the address,
which he left to be added by another hand ; probably in these early days having
heard of Reisch’s attainments without gathering his name. But even so the
address is not completed. From the fact that all the points on which Erasmus
consults Reisch occur at the beginning of the first volume of J erome in the 1516
edition (Ep. 396), and that Erasmus was already at work on his scholia at this
time (Epp. 307 and 313), it is clear that the date given by the Deventer MS. for
Ep. 309 is correct.

Gregory, sometimes wrongly Georgo, Reisch († 9 May 1525) of Balingen
in the Wurtemberg Schwarzwald, matriculated at Freiburg 25 Oct. 1487
and became B.A. 1488, MA. 1489. Subsequently he seems to have studied at
Heidelberg, where he composed 1115 Marqarita philosophica, a kind of encyclopaedia
for the purposes of catechetical instruction ; first printed by John Schott
at Freiburg, c. 13 July 1503. Before that time he had entered the Carthusian
house of the Mount of St. John Baptist, near Freiburg, where John Eck was one
of his pupils xEck, Epist. de rat. εἰκαῖον-1οη suorum); and in 1502 had risen to be
Prior. Later he became Visitor of the Carthusians in the province of the
Rhine‚ a title which is given to him in his Priuileyia ordinis cartusiensis, Basle,
Io. Amorbach, 15 J an. 1510. An edition of Geiler's Nauicula Penitentie, Augsburg,
J. Otmar, c. 8 Sept. 1511, is dedicated to him by his pupil James Otther; who in
his preface, 15 Nov. 1510, speaks of the friendship subsisting between Reisch
and Geiler. For his interest in Jerome at this time 500 p. 211. He was
confessor to Maximilian, to whose deathbed he was summoned at Wels in 1519.
He died at Freiburg during the Peasants' Revolt. The Hebrew dictionary and
