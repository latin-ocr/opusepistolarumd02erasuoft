To ANDREW AMMONIUS.

[1515, because the New Testament is nearly finished. From the movements
of Galeazzo (l. 1) and Pace (1. 7) at this time, as detailed in Brewer ii, it may
be doubted whether they actually came to Basle, as stated in this letter. More
probably Erasmus composed this and Ep. 377 in readiness for their coming,
announced beforehand ; writing in terms as though they had already arrived]

ERASMVS AMMONIO SVO S. D.

GALEATIVS hic qui isthuc Mediolanensium nomine orator aduolat
et has adfert, intra mensem hac redire cogitur. Nos hic ad Calendas
Martias sedebimus ς per 1111110, quaeso te, scribe, si quid est quod me
scire oporteat. Eboracensis bello somnio me bearat de praebenda
Tornacensi3 magis dolet ludibrium quam dispendium. Nouum 5
Testamentum ferme iam est absolutum. Surget ad octoginta ferme
codicillos. Leoni dicabitur. Cum Paceo qui 1110 agit, literis tantum
sum collocutus. Bene vale ac scribe.

[An autograph, written very hastily and folded up wet, so that the last line
has blotted across. Erasmus not infrequently wrote rough drafts of his letters
(cf. Ep. 534. 66, 7); and though most of them were doubtless copied fair by his
secretaries (cf. Ep. 388. 181, 2), some he wrote out again himself. In this
0350 1115 113510 caused him to omit a passage (see ll. 13, 4), probably through
a familiar form of error. The editors of E dealt with the truncated sentence
drastically; and their necessity there encouraged them to treat the text of the
whole letter with remarkable freedom. It is clear that they had in their hands,
not Erasmus· rough draft, which would have contained the missing clause,
but this original or a copy made from it after receipt. very probably the auto-

(born 0. 1456), 3 Μ11311050 noble, who

influence with the Swiss, and was also
acting as confidential agent for Henry

Vin. By 1521 he ‘had gone over to
the French interest, and was en-
deavouring to recover Milan for them
from the Spaniards. Alciati's edition
of Tacitus, Basle, Froben, Aug. 1519, is
dedicated to him.

See Brewer, where the last mention
of him 15 111 1526 ; and Rawdon Brown,
