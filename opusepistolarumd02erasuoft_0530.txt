502 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1517Ἰ

linguae peritiam quantum ille tenet philosophiae, quantum theo-¹
legiae! tum quae animi puritas, qui discendi ardor, qui docendi
candor, quae disputandi modestia! Mihi sane vir ille primo statim
gustu placuit olim Papiae, cum illic philosophiam profiteretur: nunc
propius intuito magis etiam placet. Is demum vere mihi videtur
Israhelitam agere suoque cognomini pulchre respondere: cuius
omnis voluptas, omnis cura, omne ocium ac negocium in diuinis
631 literis. Dignus nimirum animus cui ocium contingat quam
maxime honorificum. Eruditissimo eruditorum omnium Moecenati
Cardinali Gurcensi facito me commendatum. Bene vale.
Antuerpiae. decimo Mar. Anno. M.D.XV1.

550. To JOHN HUTTICH (ἲ).

Querela Pacis (1517) p. 503. Antwerp.
Lond. xxix. 10: LB. i. 329. (6. March 5³> 1517.

[The preface to a translation of Lucian's Conuiuium, which is added to Froben's
edition, Dec. 1517, of the translations made by More and Erasmus from Lucian
(cf. Ep. 187 introd.). The volume begins with the Querela Pacis and the Declamatio
sle Morte, and was intended to contain besides the Lucian the Utopz‘a and the two
friends’ Epiqrcmzmata; but at p. 644, on reaching the end of More’s Lucubrationes,
Froben brought the book to a close ; and the Utopz'a and Epiqrammata were
published in a separate volume of 356 pages in the following March.

This preface may be dated either in this period (cf. Epp. 543. 1 n. and
551. 9, 10); or, as by Dr. Reich, after Erasmus’ return from England, when he
was finally putting together the material for the volume and transmitting it to
Basle (Epp. 584. 15—7 and 597).

John Eutychius or Eutichius is mentioned by Sti-omer in a letter of 24 J uly
1517 from Mainz (LB. App. 156); from which it appears that he had recently
been in correspondence with Erasmus, and that, though usually resident in'
Mainz‚ he was then absent. He may therefore very probably be identified with
John Huttich of Mainz (c. 1488—5 March 15443 cf. BRE. 383), the author of
Collectanea antiquitatum in vrbe atque (tyro Mogyuntino repertarum, Mainz, J. Schofferf
March 1520; in the preface to which, dated 22 July 1517 ‘ex arce Curcellina
regni deserti ' (Courcelles, near Metz 3 or, as Falk 311586313- Kirkel in Westrich,
near Zweibriicken)‚ he speaks with intimacy of Erasmus For Huttich see
Bauch in Archivf. Litteraturyesch. xii (1884), pp. 360-73 andin Beitr. ε. Gesch. cl.
Univ. Maz'n: u. Giessen, 1907, pp. 62-71.

The identification of Courcelles I owe to Mr. E. Heaxvood, Librarian of the
Royal Geographical Society, who has pointed out to me that ‘regnum desertum '
must be the same as ¹ vastum regnum ’, a name given in the maps of Lorraine
and Germany in Schott’s edition of Ptolemy, Sti-asburg, 12 March 1513, 10 1116
region between the Saar and the Moselle, in which Courcelles lies; also that
the same region is called ‘Vuesterich ' and ‘ Vuestsirych ’ in the maps of France
and Germany in Miinster's cosmographia, Basle, H. Petri⁷ Sept. 1554. Miinster
on his p. 462 admits that the meaning of the name was uncertain3 so that his
translation of it into ‘ occiduum regnum' and Huttich’s earlier ‘regnum
desertum’ may be taken as learned popular etymologies.]
