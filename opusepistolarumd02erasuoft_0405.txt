FROM ALARD OF AMSTERDAM

vnum omnes in vniuersum distrahat. Index mihi iam non suppetit ;
certo tamen scio domi suae libris amplius mille delitescere blattisque
vndecunque praerodi, libris inquam reconditissimis atque eisdem
vetustissimis ; in quos si incidas, haud quaquam te reperisse clamabis

id quod pueri in faba.

Homo qui hanc apparatissimam Rod01<phi> 35

Agricolae suppellectilem librariam tam negligenter tamque clam
omnibus asseruat, vix dum contriuit Aesopum3 satrapam diuitiis,

fastu Trasonem modis omnibus adumbrat.
cuius aedes vulgo Paradisus appellatur.
nostro vt κατάλογον mihi tuo nomine transmittat3 id quod pro veteri 40
inter nos necessitudine haud cunctanter, opinor, faciet.

Amstelredamis habitat ;
Scripsi cum tabellione

Ad haec,

Quod si fata meis patiantur ducere vitam
Auspiciis et sponte mea componere curas,

sub Calendas Ianuarias proximas sacris operaturus Amstelredamos

concedam. Quare si ipse fortasse non transmittat, ego quoque tibi 45

fideliter allaturus ad te quicquid indidem postulabis, etiamsi maximo
foret redimendum. Non possum non satis mirari, quod praeter alia
non parum multa in naeniis nostris et huius quoque versiculi,

Vt fies, vt gemis, vt micasque pectus,

structuram amice reprehendis; cum tamen modo haud ita dissimili 50

vtatur Horatius, Si tacitus pasci posset etc.

men of letters; and he was strong
enough, when Eric Walkendorp, Bp. of
Trondhiem, fieeing from Christiern 11
of Denmark and Norway, took refuge
with him in 1521, to refuse to surren-
der him to the king. He had inherited
Agricola’s papers from his uncle, and
from other sources (Ag1·ic.² f0. †) ; and
he was afterwards very generous in
placing them at Alard's disposal (cf.
p. 269). His character is illustrated
by a book of devotions, Psallerium diui
Hieronymi in modum septem horarum
abbreuiatum : septem Psalmi poenitentiales
Francisci Petrarchae: et aliae prece-S,
printed for him in Paris at his own
eost, by John Dupr6, 20 Dec. 1519, 16⁰,
as a handy volume for merchants like
himself to carry about. Pontanus had

seen a copy, which may be the same
as that afterwards in the possession

cf P. A. Crevenna of Amsterdam (see
the catalogue raisovme' of Crevenna's
books, 1776, vol. i, p. 52), which was
sold by auction in 1790.

The Paradise was perhaps the great
corner house in the Kalbergasse near
the Papenbrucksteg, in which von

Zesen (Besclcreibunq der Stadt Amsterdam,
1664, pp. 3934] describes Pompeius’ son
Sibrand as living in 1556. A street in
that neighbourhood was named after
him, the Pompeiussteg. Agricola’s
papers were still in Sibrand's posses-
sion in 1561, when Viglius Zuichem
presented him with a pertrait of
Agricola to be put up in his library.
