Guy Morillon (†2 Oct. 1548) appears first in Paris, where in Jan. 1507 he
edited the Epistles of Horace (D. Roce), in Aug. the Heroides and Ibis of Ovid
(D. Roce) for the use of pupils living in his house 3 and in Aug. 1508 Suetonius
(G. Gourmont and D. Roce, 1509), from a MS. belonging to the Abbey of St. Victor.
At some time 110 0001110 to have taught Greek at Louvain‚ but his alleged con-
nexion with Busleiden's college is not substantiated. Like Barbirius he was
a client of Le Sauvage, and went to Spain in 1517. Ultimately he obtained
the post of secretary to Gharles v, whom he accompanied to Spain in 1522
(EE2. 15), remaining there continuously till 1531 (Lond. xxvii. 4, LB. 1196).
In Feb. 153² he was in the Netherlands again (ΟΕ. p. 199), but by Aug. 1534
110 had returned to Spain (Jortin ii. 415). His last years were spent in retire-
ment at Louvain‚ where he worked at Livy, with assistance from Budaeus,
but published nothing. In the Aduersaria of Budaeus (Delaruelle, p. 274) he
is described as ‘officialis de Iosas’. About June 1517 (Ep. 587) 110 married
Elizabeth de Mil († 2ο Dec. 1552); and had two sons, Maximilian (ψ 26 March
1586) Bp. of Tournay, and Antony († 11 Oct. 1556) who became famous as an
antiquary.

republished in his Renaissance des Lettres en Βεῖῃίφιε, 1890, pp. 214-23, where
Mox-illon’s services to Erasmus are exaggerated through a misprint, primus for
primas, p. 222, 1. 4. Van Even's first article gives a reproduction of the triptych,
with portrasts, painted by Michael Coxie for the family tomb erected by
Maximilian Morillon in St. Peter's Church at Louvain. Two letters from
Erasmus (Jortin ii. 414,5) and one from Budaeus to Guy Morillon are printed

GVIDO MORILLONVS DOMINO SVO ERAsMO S. D.

Nou licuit theologo nost-ro per subitum discessum ad litteras tuas
rescribere, mi domine. Iniunxit mihi vt rescriberem: imothopien-
sem Decanum me tantisper esse iussit, dum abest. Ad id etiam
theologicum caduceum meae credidit fidei, vt in 1110 0111111110 sit
dignitatum fores vel claudere vel aperire3 fatis imputandum quod 5
solus excludor. Vides, mi domine, quantum eum esse oportuerit-
cuius sola absentia factum est vt tantus essem. Omnes quaqua
incedo me benigne salutant, reuerenter compellant, ad cenam vocant,
quid in hoc vel in illo negocio actum, sine fine rogitant. Litterarum
sarcinae vndique ad me commigrant. In summa ex Gnidone prag· 10
maticus, id est theologus, factus sum, nisi quod de ducatis mirum
est interim silentium: nihil forsan ad Vtopiensem Vicarium hoc
attinere putant. Si ita est, non tam honorat mandatum mihi
officium quam onerat. Vix mihi persuadere possum theologum
ipsum tantum negociorum strepitum tam diu sustinere potuisse, nisi 15
fessum subinde refouisset dea illa ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε quam Monaetam
vocant. Nam et huius deae fauore propicio nuper ad te litteras
aureas misit, ne haec commentitia putes. Rogo doceas quibus sacris
