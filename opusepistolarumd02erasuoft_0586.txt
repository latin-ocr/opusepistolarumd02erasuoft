5581. 21. Cobergio] John Koberger (c.
¹455 -— 1 Mar. 1543‘„ first cousin of

placed in 1519); 111 1519 Froben calls
him ‘ Papiensis’ (LE2. 149); but after-

Antony Koberger (1440— 3 Oct. 1513),
the celebrated printer of Nuremberg.
After 1513 John carried on the firm
on behalf of Antony‘s sons The
eldest of these, Antony (25 Mar. 1498—
1532), was now beginning to take part
in the business 3 which since 1504 had
been that of publishing rather than
printing. But clearly John is intended
here. See Ο. Hase, Die Koberyer, Leipzig,
1885, and Proctor.

Paraphrasis] The first of these,
on the Romans, appeared in Nov. 1517.

23. epistolis] See Ep. 71 introd.

Antibarbaros] See Ep. 3ο. 16 n.

24. Greyus] See Ep. 58 inti-od.

30. Calui] F. J. Calvus of Ticino or
Como, a bookseller who on his business
Journeyings had made many friends
among the literary men of his time.
About 1518 he changed his name from
Julius to MinutiusfflRE. 120, c. Aug.
1518, because D¹ is in hand; wrongly

wards he settled at Rome as a printer,
where Panzer gives books printed by
him 1524-31. In 1545 he was living
at Milan, where he had been ill for
more than two years (BRE. 362 and
395). Twenty-six letters from Alciati
to him at Rome, 1518-32, and two
from Beatus Rhenanus to him at Pavia,
1519, are printed in Marquarcli Gudii
Epistulae, ed. P. Burmann, Utrecht,
1697, pp. 75-113 and 151,2.

He is not to be confused with Fabius
Calvus of Ravenna, for whom he pub-
lished some translations from {lippo-

crates, Rome, 15253 cf. Lond. xix. 16, ·

LB. 921 and 'EE. 65.

The original of the letter mentioned
here, dated 10 Feb. 1²517, is the Basle
MS. G. ΙΙ. 33. 24. In it Calvus intro-
duces himself to Froben, announces
that he is going to start as a printer at
Genoa, and proposes to exchange the
productions of their presses.
