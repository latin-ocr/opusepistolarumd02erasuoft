524] FROM ANTON Y GLAVA ’ 451

reliquum est, et Caesar te plurimum salutat et Claua tuus sese tuae
commendat fidei; vtque nos commendare velis communi domino 30
praestantissimo Cancellario regio, non solum petimus sed etiam
oramus. Vale, mi doctissime Erasme.

Gandaui, Octauo idus Februarii.

525. FROM ROBERT DE KEYSERE.

Deventer Ms. 91, f. 163. Ghent.
LB. App. 102. (c. 6 February 1517.)

[Evidently contemporary with Ep. 524.‘

The notice of Robert de Keysere in Ep. 175 introd. may be greatly amplified
from two publications by Μ. Van den Gheyn and M. Victor Vander Haeghen in
the Annales de la Soc. cZ’Hist. et d’Arche'ol. cle Gand, viii. 1907-8. He was born
0. 1470, and was a brother of the miniature-painter Clara de Keysere. By 1496
he had become M.A. and was at Paris. About 1517, whilst tutor to Leopold of
Austria (Ep. 585. 3 n.)‚ he composed a book for Leopold's marriage, in which
he advocated the foundation of a university at Tournay. The scheme failed at
first, because of the political vicissitudes of the town (cf. Lond. xvii. 12,
LB. 595); but on its restoration to the Netherlands‚ de Keysere renewed
his proposal in 1523, only to be defeated a second time by opposition from
Louvain. Μ. Van den Gheyn's article describes an Escurial MS. which is the
presentation copy of an Officium Salomonis composed by de Keysere for Charles v
in June 1520, and probably illuminated by his sister. He married 0. Oct. 1526y
and died in 1532, leaving three sons]

ROBERTVS CAESAR DOMINO ERASMO Ro. S.

SALVE, mi mellitissime Erasme. An nugas meas receperis cupio
scire. Refricas animum meum in litteris tuis ad Clauam. cum
inquis, ‘Par est illum agere quippiam Caesare dignum’. Quorsum
alludis nescio. Quod Claua rescripsit me ius meum amplecti strenue,
non magis mirum est quam frigidos esse Gandenses omnes. Nun· 5
quam magis me cognominis mei et amplae domus meae quam hodie
puduit, cum abhinc triennium alterum contubernalem consequi non
potuerim. Ita fortuna communium, vt dicitur, alterum, alterum
nunc frigus pungit premitque, vt totus in vacuo meo Lynce me
contineam, et mea me[a] paupertate consolans quasique limax in sua 10-
testa; cui nunc salem addiS, quod Cancellario meo nos non com-
mendas aut non poteris per occasionem. Reuiuiscam tamen, cum
Caesar ad te scribet; nunc Robertus ad te scribit. Vale, litterarum
praesidium. Gandaui ex Lynce.
