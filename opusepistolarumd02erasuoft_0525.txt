546. FROM RUTGER REscms.
Deventer MS, 91, f. 162 v0. Louvain.
LB. App. 54. 8 March (1317).

[Referring to the printing of Cl ; cf. vol. i. p. 594. As Martens’ two questions
concern the preface and Ep. 541, it is clear that sheet a was now being printed.

The compression used to work Ep. 529 into sheet a, shows that sheet b and per-
haps others, not further than m (Ep. 548), were already set up.

Reegeer Ressen (†2 Oct. 1545) of Maeseyck (hence Dryopolitanus) in Limburg,
on the Mense, was a pupil of Aleander in Paris, and was Β.Α. there in 1513-14.
He then settled at Louvain, where he was Bachelor of Law 22 Aug. 1515, and

supported himself by teaching (cf. EE. 175), and by correcting for Martens'
press; the first book known to be corrected by him bearing date May 1516.
When Erasmus came to Louvain in July 1517 Rescius soon became intimate

with him (cf. Lond. iii. 43, LB. 232) ; and to this, no doubt, his appointment
as first Professor of Greek in Busleiden’s CoIlege, 1 Sept. 1518, was in a measure

due. In 1527 Francis 1 invited him to fill the Greek chair in the College de
Franc03 but he remained faithful to Louvain‚ in spite of many attacks which
had been made upon him there. In 1529, when Martens retired from printing,
Rescius founded a pressa, in partnership at first with J. Sturm, and in 1530 with
Barth. Gravius. In the preface to his first volume, Xenophon's Memorabilia,
Sept. 1529, he announces his aim of printing books suitable for the students
of Busleiden’s College, and especially Greek ; and this promise was abundantly
fulfined. He discharged the duties of his chair till the end of his life, but

not always without obloquy3 cf. Lond. xxx. 74. LB. 1299, and Goclen's letter

which it answerS. Amongst his pupils were Nic. Clenard (Ep. 291. 107 n.)
and Paul Leopardus. See A. Roersch in Revue Ge'ne'rale‚ 1906, and in BN.]

DOMINO ERASMO ROTERODAMO RVTGERVS RESCIVS S. P. D.

EST in tua epistola ad Guolphangum Fabricium, Erasme vnde-
cunque doctissime, non procul a fine locus nobis sane omnino
inuius, sic incipiens: ‘Tum audio nonnullos alia quaedam moliri,
quae ad Christi cognitionem nihil adferant, sed funcios tantum
offendant oculis hominum! Quem quum Paludano et Nouiomago 5
ostendissem, ipsi mecum in eodem haesitantes luto nihilque temere
mutandum censentes consuluerunt ipsum locum tibi, antequam
imprimeretur, indicandum. Dorpius ficmos tantum offundant legen-
dum coniectauit. Theodericus igitur hac epistolae parte excudenda
relicta in praesentia ad te ipsum exemplar mittit, obnixe orans vt ¹0
super istius loci lectione sibi quamprimum sententiam tuam aperias.
